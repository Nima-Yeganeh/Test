IT engineers should learn OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as it is a popular and widely used routing protocol in computer networks. OSPF is used to determine the best route for data packets to travel through a network. It's important for IT engineers to know how to configure and troubleshoot OSPF networks, as it can help ensure network efficiency and minimize downtime. IT engineers may also need to implement OSPF in order to comply with industry standards and best practices. Overall, having a deep understanding of OSPF can help IT engineers better manage and optimize their networks.
