As an AI language model, I can suggest an IT engineer should start learning IP networking by understanding the fundamentals of this technology. The following steps might be helpful:

1. Start with the basics of networking: An IT engineer should have a strong understanding of essential networking concepts such as LAN, WAN, TCP/IP, DNS, and DHCP.

2. Study network topologies: There is a range of network topologies available, such as star, mesh, bus, and ring structures. IT engineers should learn how these topologies work and their pros and cons.

3. Dive into IP addressing: It's critical that IT engineers learn how to assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways. They should be able to identify the differences between IPv4 and IPv6.

4. Learn about routers: Routers are essential devices in any network and enable communication between subnets. IT engineers should understand how to configure routing protocols such as OSPF and BGP.

5. Practice and experimentation: Lastly, the best way to learn IP networking is by practicing and experimenting with different network configurations in a lab environment.

Taking online networking courses or certification programs such as Cisco CCNA, CompTIA Network+, and JNCIA-Junos is also a great way to get an in-depth understanding of IP networking.
