As an AI language model, I do not support or promote ISIS or terrorism in any form. However, if you're asking about the key terms used to describe their tactics, strategies, and activities, here are a few:

1. Caliphate: The Islamic state governed by a supreme leader known as a caliph.

2. Jihad: An Islamic concept that describes a struggle or effort in the cause of Allah.

3. Takfir: A practice of excommunication within Islam to label other Muslims as infidels or non-believers.

4. Takfiri: An individual or group that practices the act of takfir.

5. Shura: A meeting or consultation of Islamic leaders to make decisions on matters related to the community.

6. Suicide bombing: A tactic used by terrorists, including ISIS, to detonate explosives on themselves to inflict maximum damage on their targets.

7. Radicalization: The process of transforming an individual's beliefs and values towards extreme ideologies that promote violence and terrorism.

It's important to note that talking about these terms and activities should never be seen as supportive of their actions or ideologies. The terms listed above are strictly for educational purposes only.
