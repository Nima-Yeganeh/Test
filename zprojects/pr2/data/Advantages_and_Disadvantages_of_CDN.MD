CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which is a network of servers that are distributed across the globe. The main purpose of a CDN is to reduce the latency associated with accessing web content by serving the content from the server that is closest to the user's physical location. 

Advantages of CDN:

1. Improved website performance: By reducing the distance between the server and the end-user, CDN helps to improve website load times and overall performance.

2. Increased reliability: CDNs typically offer a higher level of reliability and uptime than a single server, which can be subject to downtime due to hardware failures or maintenance.

3. Better scalability: CDNs can handle large traffic volumes by distributing the load across multiple servers, allowing websites to scale up or down as needed.

4. Improved security: CDNs can provide an added layer of security by protecting websites from DDoS attacks, website scraping, and other types of cyber threats.

Disadvantages of CDN:

1. Additional cost: Utilizing a CDN can be more expensive than hosting content on a single server as it involves additional infrastructure and maintenance costs.

2. Complexity: Setting up and maintaining a CDN can be complicated, requiring specialized technical expertise.

3. Data privacy concerns: CDNs may require data to be stored on servers located in different countries, which can raise privacy and compliance concerns in some contexts. 

4. Limited control: Using a CDN limits an organization's control over the delivery of content. It can also impact the ability to use some website features, such as dynamic content or cookies.
