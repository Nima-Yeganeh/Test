Advantages of Logging SIEM:
1. Proactive security monitoring: SIEM allows for continuous monitoring of all network activity, providing proactive detection of security threats.

2. Centralized management: With SIEM, IT personnel can monitor and manage security events through a centralized dashboard, even across multiple systems and locations.

3. Better compliance: SIEM can help organizations meet regulatory standards by providing an auditable record of all network activity.

4. Faster incident response: SIEM allows for rapid detection, investigation, and remediation of security incidents. 

5. Integration with other security tools: SIEM can integrate with other security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS) and vulnerability scanners, providing a more comprehensive security solution.

Disadvantages of Logging SIEM:
1. Complexity: SIEM can be complex and difficult to implement and maintain.

2. Cost: SIEM can be expensive, especially for smaller organizations with limited resources.

3. False Positives: SIEM can generate a high number of false positives, leading to alert fatigue and decreased efficiency.

4. Training: SIEM requires highly skilled personnel to effectively manage and operate the system.

5. Overreliance: There is a risk of over-reliance on SIEM, leading to neglect of other important security measures.
