Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, a storage device, a server, or a network. It enables multiple operating systems or applications to run on a single physical machine, by creating several virtual machines or instances. This technology allows for better utilization of hardware resources and improves efficiency, scalability, and flexibility of IT infrastructure. Virtualization is commonly used in cloud computing, data center management, and software development and testing.
