IT engineers should learn MySQL because it is one of the most widely used open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is easy to use, scalable, and secure. MySQL is used by many large corporations, startups, and websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Airbnb. By learning MySQL, IT engineers can develop skills in managing large amounts of data, designing databases, data security, and application development. Additionally, MySQL is used with many popular programming languages like PHP, Python, and Java, so it is important for IT engineers who want to develop back-end solutions.
