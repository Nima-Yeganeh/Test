Sure, here are some tips and tricks for using Cisco:

1. Keyboard shortcuts: Knowing and using keyboard shortcuts for Cisco can help increase your productivity. Here are some important keyboard shortcuts to know:

- Ctrl+N: Start a new session
- Ctrl+W: Close the current tab
- Ctrl+T: Open a new tab
- Ctrl+Shift+T: Reopen the last closed tab
- Ctrl+Shift+W: Close the current window

2. CLI shortcuts: The Command Line Interface (CLI) in Cisco devices has some useful shortcut commands that can save time and effort. Here are a few important ones to know:

- Tab: Complete a command or parameter
- Up arrow: Recall the previous command
- Ctrl+Z: Exit configuration mode and return to privilege mode
- Ctrl+C: Terminate the current command and return to privilege mode
- Erase + Enter: Clear the current line of text

3. Use the "?" command: When in doubt, use the "?" command to query the device for possible commands or options. This is especially useful when working with commands that have multiple options or parameters.

4. Use configuration templates: Configuring multiple Cisco devices can be time-consuming and error-prone. To simplify the process, use configuration templates to quickly apply settings to multiple devices at once.

5. Back up your configurations: It's important to back up your Cisco configurations regularly to avoid data loss in case of any unexpected events. You can use the "copy running-config tftp" command to save your configuration file to a TFTP server.

I hope these tips and tricks are helpful to you!
