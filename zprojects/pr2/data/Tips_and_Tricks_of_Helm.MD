Helm is a powerful package manager for Kubernetes. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of it:

1. Use "helm lint" before installing a chart to catch any errors or problems in your Chart.yaml file.

2. Use "helm search" to search for ready-made charts on public repositories like Helm Hub or create your own chart.

3. Use "helm upgrade" to upgrade your application and perform a rolling deployment of new pods without downtime.

4. Use "helm rollback" to quickly roll back to the previous version in case of any issues during a deployment.

5. Use "helm template" to view the template files that will be used to deploy an application before actually deploying.

6. Use "helm list" to quickly check what applications are currently deployed and their status.

7. Use "helm package" to create a chart package that can be shared with others or used for version control.

8. Use "helm install --debug --dry-run" to simulate an installation to verify the syntax of your chart and the values you are passing.

9. Use "helm dependency update" to download the dependencies for your chart.

10. Use "helm history" to view the history of an application and the various releases that have been deployed.
