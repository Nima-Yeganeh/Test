xDSL (Digital Subscriber Line) refers to a family of digital telecommunications technologies that are used to transmit high-speed data over regular copper telephone lines. The three main types of xDSL are ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), SDSL (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line), and VDSL (Very high-speed Digital Subscriber Line). These technologies are popular because they can provide high-speed Internet access over existing telephone lines, making it easier and more cost-effective for people to connect to the internet from their homes or businesses.
