As a chatbot, here are some recommendations for IT engineers to learn Cloud:

1. Start with the basics: Before diving into a specific cloud service provider, make sure to have a good understanding of cloud computing concepts such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

2. Choose a cloud provider: Choose a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure to focus on. Each of them has their own set of services, benefits, and limitations, so choose one which suits your requirement.

3. Develop practical skills: Create your own cloud environment and practice by deploying a simple web application on it. This will give you practical skills and experience. 

4. Emphasize on security: Since cloud security is a major concern, it's important to understand best practices for securing cloud infrastructure and maintaining compliance.

5. Continue to learn: Finally, keep yourself updated with new updates and services. Attend webinars, read articles and practice regularly to keep your skills up to date.
