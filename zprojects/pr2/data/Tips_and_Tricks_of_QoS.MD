QoS, or Quality of Service, is a set of techniques that can help ensure that network traffic behaves as desired and meets specific performance requirements. Here are some tips and tricks of QoS:

1. Identify your application requirements: Before setting up QoS, you should first identify the applications and services that are critical to your business. This will help you determine which traffic needs to be prioritized and which can be deprioritized.

2. Prioritize traffic: Once you have identified your critical applications, you should prioritize their traffic. This can be achieved through policies that assign higher priority levels to the traffic of important applications while assigning lower priority levels to less important applications.

3. Use traffic shaping: Traffic shaping is a QoS technique that can help regulate the flow of traffic on your network. This can help prevent congestion and ensure that critical traffic is given the bandwidth it needs to function properly.

4. Implement Quality of Service (QoS) policies: QoS policies allow you to apply different network traffic control techniques to specific applications, users, or network segments. This can help you prioritize traffic, limit bandwidth, control latency, and manage packet loss.

5. Monitor network performance: You should regularly monitor your network performance to ensure that your QoS policies are functioning properly. This can be achieved through continuous monitoring of network traffic, bandwidth utilization, and latency.

By taking these steps, you can help ensure that your network traffic is prioritized correctly and that important applications are able to function as expected under high network loads.
