An IT engineer can learn Git by following these steps:

1. Understand the basics of version control: Before diving into Git, it's essential to have a thorough understanding of the basics of version control. You need to understand the concepts of repositories, branches, merges, commits, and more.

2. Install Git: The next step is to install Git on your computer. Git is a command-line tool, so you'll need to be comfortable using the terminal.

3. Set up a Git repository: Once you have installed Git, the next step is to set up a repository. A repository is where all your Git files will be stored. To set up a repository, create a new folder, open a terminal, navigate to this folder, and run the command 'git init.'

4. Familiarize yourself with Git commands: Git comes with a set of commands that you'll need to learn to control your repository. Some of the most commonly used Git commands include git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git branch, and git merge.

5. Practice with Git exercises: Once you're familiar with the fundamental concepts and commands of Git, you should start practicing with Git exercises. There are many resources available online that provide exercises to help you improve your Git skills.

6. Collaborate on a Git project: Collaborating on a Git project with other engineers is an excellent way to learn Git. You'll learn how to merge branches, resolve conflicts, and work in a team.

In conclusion, learning Git requires a bit of patience and practice, but it's an essential skill for any IT engineer.
