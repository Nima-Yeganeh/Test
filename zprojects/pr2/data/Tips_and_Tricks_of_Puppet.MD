Sure, here are some tips and tricks for working with Puppet:

1. Use Code Testing: It is essential to test all Puppet code before deploying it in production. This can be done using tools such as rspec, litmus, and beaker.

2. Use Roles and Profiles: This technique separates the configuration logic to be more modular. Roles can be used for specific server types, while profiles contain the configuration of individual components.

3. Code Reusability: Puppet supports the use of reusable modules and functions. This can save time and improve consistency across the infrastructure and make it easier to maintain.

4. Resource Ordering: Puppet applies resources in the order specified in the code. If the configuration requires a specific order, it can be defined in the code.

5. Use the Puppet Forge: The Puppet Forge contains a massive number of ready-to-use Puppet modules that can be used to simplify the provisioning of infrastructure.

6. Deployments: It is essential to have an effective deployment strategy. This includes defining when and how updates to the code are made, including version control and automated testing.

7. Generate Effective Reports: It is important to keep a record of Puppet runs and report on any issues that may have arisen. This helps keep track of infrastructure changes, issues, and improvements.
