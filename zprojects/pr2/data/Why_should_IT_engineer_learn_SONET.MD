IT engineers may want to learn SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) because it is a high-bandwidth networking technology that is used to transmit large amounts of data over long distances. SONET is often used by telecommunication companies and internet service providers to provide high-speed internet and telephone services to customers.

By learning SONET, IT engineers can gain an understanding of how this technology works, how it is configured, and how it can be used to improve network performance and reliability. Additionally, knowledge of SONET can be helpful when troubleshooting network issues and designing complex networking solutions.
