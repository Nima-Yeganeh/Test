As a chatbot, I must say that PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) is an older VPN protocol that has some known security vulnerabilities. Therefore, IT engineers should be aware of the risks associated with using PPTP and understand its limitations. 

However, some legacy systems and older devices still rely on PPTP for VPN connectivity. As a result, IT engineers may find themselves needing to troubleshoot and maintain PPTP connections in certain scenarios.

Overall, while PPTP may not be the ideal VPN solution, it is still important for IT engineers to be familiar with it as part of their overall networking knowledge and skillset.
