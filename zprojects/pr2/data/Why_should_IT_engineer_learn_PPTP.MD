IT engineers should learn Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) because it is a widely-used protocol for creating Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). VPNs enable users to securely access private networks and data from a remote location. PPTP is an older protocol that is not as secure as newer alternatives like OpenVPN or IPSec, but it is still commonly used in many organizations because of its ease of use and compatibility with a wide range of devices. As an IT engineer, being familiar with PPTP can help you troubleshoot VPN issues, evaluate the security implications of using the protocol, and make informed decisions about implementing or migrating to newer VPN technologies.
