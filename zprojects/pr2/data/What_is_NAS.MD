NAS stands for Network Attached Storage. It is a type of storage technology that allows multiple users and devices to store and access data from a centralized location over a network. It typically consists of one or more hard drives housed in a dedicated enclosure that connects to a network router or switch. NAS systems are commonly used for home and small business environments for data backup, file sharing, media streaming, and remote access.
