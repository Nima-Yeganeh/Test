IT engineers should learn Quality of Service (QoS) because it helps to ensure that network traffic is prioritized and managed effectively. This is particularly important in environments that utilize real-time applications such as voice or video conferencing, where having low-latency and uninterrupted service is critical. By understanding QoS, IT engineers can configure network devices and protocols to prioritize and manage traffic, ensuring that mission-critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and resources. Ultimately, this can help to improve network performance, reduce latency, and enhance the overall quality and reliability of network services for end-users.
