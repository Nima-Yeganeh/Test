Here are some tips and tricks of Agile:

1. Prioritize tasks: Agile methodology is all about prioritization, so you should always focus on the most important tasks first. Use methods like the MoSCoW method to determine which tasks are must-have, should-have, could-have, and won't-have.

2. Break down tasks into smaller pieces: It's easier to tackle a big project if you break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. You can use techniques like user stories and sprints to keep your team organized and focused.

3. Communicate frequently: Communication is key in Agile methodology. You should conduct daily stand-up meetings and sprint reviews to keep everyone on the same page.

4. Embrace change: Agile is built around the idea that things may change throughout the project. Don't be afraid to change direction if it is necessary to meet the project's goals.

5. Use visual aids: Use visual aids like Kanban boards to help you track your team's progress and keep everyone motivated.

6. Encourage collaboration: Agile methodology promotes collective teamwork and shared ownership. Encourage your team members to collaborate and share their ideas with each other to achieve the project goals.
