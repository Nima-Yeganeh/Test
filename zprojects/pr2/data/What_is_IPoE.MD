IPoE stands for "Internet Protocol over Ethernet." It is a method of connecting to the internet that involves using Ethernet technology to transport IP packets between a user's device and the internet service provider's (ISP) network. This method allows for fast and reliable internet connections that can support multiple devices at once, making it a popular choice for home and business internet users.
