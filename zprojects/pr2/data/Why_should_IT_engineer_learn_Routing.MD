IT engineers should learn routing concepts because routing is a fundamental technology used to direct network traffic between devices on a network. Understanding routing is essential for IT engineers to design, implement, troubleshoot, and optimize network connectivity.

If IT engineers understand routing, they can:

1. Optimize the performance of network traffic by configuring routing protocols
2. Ensure high availability by implementing redundant routing paths
3. Secure network traffic by implementing routing policies and access control lists
4. Troubleshoot connectivity issues by understanding how packets are routed through the network
5. Design networks that are scalable and can accommodate growth

In summary, routing is a critical technology for IT engineers to understand because it is essential to the effective and efficient operation of computer networks.
