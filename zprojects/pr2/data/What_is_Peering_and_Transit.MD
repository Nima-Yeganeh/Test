Peering refers to the process of two internet networks exchanging traffic directly with each other without involving any third-party network. In peering, the two networks agree to exchange traffic for free based on their networkâ€™s policies.

Transit, on the other hand, refers to the process of an internet service provider (ISP) providing internet access to its customers by purchasing internet connectivity from another ISP. In transit, the ISP pays the other ISP for the data traffic it delivers to the internet.

In simpler terms, peering is when two networks connect directly to each other to exchange traffic, while transit is when an ISP pays another ISP to access the internet.
