IT engineers should learn EVPN (Ethernet VPN) because it is a technology used in data center networks to provide layer 2 and layer 3 connectivity between data center endpoints. EVPN has several benefits over traditional data center network solutions, including: 

1. Scalability: EVPN has the ability to scale to thousands of endpoints without compromising network performance.

2. Multi-tenancy: EVPN supports multiple tenants and enables separation of traffic between them.

3. Flexibility: EVPN can support a variety of use cases, including data center interconnects, campus networks, and service provider networks.

4. Resiliency: EVPN supports both active-active and active-standby configurations, providing high network availability.

5. Cost Savings: EVPN can help reduce hardware and operational expenses by optimizing the use of networking resources.

Therefore, IT engineers who learn EVPN will have a better understanding of the latest networking technologies, which will enable them to build more efficient and scalable data center networks.
