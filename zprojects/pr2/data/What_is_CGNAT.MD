CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT) is a type of network address translation (NAT) used by internet service providers (ISPs) to translate public IP addresses to private IP addresses. It is used when there are more devices than available public IP addresses. CGNAT allows multiple customers to share a single public IPv4 address while still allowing them to access the internet, and can also provide some level of security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks. However, it can sometimes cause issues such as hindered network performance or difficulty in establishing connections with other devices over the internet.
