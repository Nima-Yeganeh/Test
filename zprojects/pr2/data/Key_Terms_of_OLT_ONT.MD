OLT stands for Optical Line Terminal and is a device used in fiber optic communication networks to provide network access to multiple users or subscribers. An OLT is usually located at a central office or data center and connects to the remote subscriber devices or ONTs. 

ONT stands for Optical Network Terminal, which is a device that terminates a fiber optic line in a home or business, providing connectivity for devices. An ONT is typically installed at the customer premises and is used to convert optical signals into electrical signals that can be used by standard networking equipment such as routers, switches, or computers. 

Both OLT and ONT are essential components of fiber optic communication networks and play a crucial role in delivering high-speed internet, data, voice, and video services.
