Domain directory services are a set of tools and technologies used to manage and maintain information about domain names, IP addresses, and related resources on the internet. These services provide a centralized directory of domain names and their associated IP addresses, making it easier to locate and access resources online. Examples of domain directory services include DNS (Domain Name System), LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), an NIS (Network Information System).
