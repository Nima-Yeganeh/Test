There are several ways an IT engineer can learn QoS:

1. Study QoS theory: An IT engineer can start by studying QoS theory from different sources. This can include books, articles, or online resources that explain different concepts about QoS.

2. Learn from experts: An IT engineer can also learn QoS by attending conferences and workshops where industry experts share their knowledge and skills in QoS.

3. Practice on a test network: IT engineers can set up a test network and practice configuring QoS on different devices. This can help them understand how different QoS concepts work in real-world scenarios.

4. Use QoS software tools: There are several QoS software tools available that can help IT engineers test and validate QoS policies and configurations. They can use these tools to simulate different network scenarios and observe the impact of QoS policies on network performance.

5. Get certified: Finally, IT engineers can choose to get certified in QoS. There are several certification programs available that can help IT engineers validate their skills and knowledge in QoS.
