To learn QoS, IT engineers should start with a good foundation in network fundamentals such as TCP/IP protocols, routing, and switching. Then, they should study the QoS models, techniques and protocols. This includes understanding how to classify and mark network traffic, the different types of queuing and scheduling mechanisms, and traffic shaping and policing. IT engineers can also use simulation tools to test their knowledge of QoS before implementing in real-world scenarios. Additionally, attending industry conferences, training programs, or online courses can help them learn the latest trends and best practices in QoS.
