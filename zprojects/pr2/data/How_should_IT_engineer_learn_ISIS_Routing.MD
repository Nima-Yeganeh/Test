If you are an IT engineer looking to learn ISIS routing, here are some steps you can follow:

1. Familiarize yourself with OSI model and understand the various layers involved. ISIS routing operates at the Intermediate System to Intermediate System layer, or OSI Layer 2.

2. Get a good understanding of the ISIS protocol itself. Learn about the different types of packets used, the protocol data unit (PDU) formats, and how they are used in the routing process.

3. Learn about ISIS design and implementation in a network. This would involve understanding how ISIS interacts with other routing protocols such as OSPF, and how it can be configured and optimized for different network topologies.

4. Practice using ISIS routing by setting up a lab environment where you can configure ISIS, simulate different network scenarios, and troubleshoot any issues that come up.

5. Stay up to date on news and trends in ISIS routing. This could involve reading industry publications, attending conferences, or participating in online forums and communities.

Remember, mastering ISIS routing takes time and effort, but with the right mindset and resources, you can become proficient in this important networking technology.
