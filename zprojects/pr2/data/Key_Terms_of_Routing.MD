1. routing table: A data structure that is used by a router to select the next hop for a packet.

2. hop: A single network segment or network device that a packet must pass through on its way to its destination.

3. routing protocol: A set of rules and procedures used by routers to exchange information and update their routing tables.

4. next hop: The next router or network device that a packet must be forwarded to in order to reach its destination.

5. static routing: A routing technique in which the routes are manually configured by the network administrator.

6. dynamic routing: A routing technique in which the routes are learned and updated automatically by the routers using routing protocols.

7. metric: A value assigned to a route by a routing protocol to indicate the "cost" of using that route.

8. convergence: The process by which routers update their routing tables to reflect changes in network topology.

9. multicast routing: A technique used by routers to send data packets to a group of hosts on a network simultaneously.

10. default route: A pre-configured route that a router uses when it cannot find a more specific route to a destination network.
