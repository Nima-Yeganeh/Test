MPLS stands for Multiprotocol Label Switching, which is a technology used in telecommunications networks to direct data packets from one network node to the next based on short path labels instead of long network addresses. MPLS is used to improve the efficiency and performance of networks, particularly in the areas of quality of service (QoS) and traffic engineering. It is commonly used by service providers to offer virtual private network (VPN) services to customers, as it provides a secure and efficient way to transmit data between geographically diverse locations.
