PPPoE stands for Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. It is a network protocol that is used to establish a point-to-point connection between two network nodes over the Ethernet protocol. PPPoE is often used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to provide internet access to their customers. It requires a username and password to establish a connection and provides a mechanism for managing and negotiating the connection parameters between the two nodes.
