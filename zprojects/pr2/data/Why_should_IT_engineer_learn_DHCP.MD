IT engineers should learn DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) because it is a critical network protocol that is used to assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to network devices automatically. IT engineers responsible for network configuration and management should understand how DHCP works, how to install and configure DHCP servers and client devices, how to troubleshoot DHCP-related issues, and how to secure DHCP to ensure the integrity and availability of their network.

DHCP is widely used in enterprise networks, internet service providers (ISPs), small offices, and home networks, making it an essential protocol for networking professionals to master. By learning DHCP, IT engineers can improve their network management skills, increase network efficiency, and reduce troubleshooting time and effort.
