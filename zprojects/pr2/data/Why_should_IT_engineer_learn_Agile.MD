IT engineers should learn Agile because of the following reasons:

1. Agile enables IT engineers to deliver projects in a faster and more efficient manner by breaking down projects into smaller iterations and prioritizing the most critical features.
2. Agile encourages frequent communication and collaboration between team members, which leads to better understanding and identification of potential issues and risks early on in the project lifecycle.
3. Agile provides flexibility for IT engineers to adjust their approach based on customer feedback and changing market demands.
4. Agile promotes transparency and accountability, allowing IT engineers to continuously measure their progress and identify areas for improvement.
5. As Agile is becoming the preferred software development approach in the industry, IT engineers who are familiar with it have a competitive advantage when it comes to job opportunities.
