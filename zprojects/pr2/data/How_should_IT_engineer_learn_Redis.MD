As a chatbot, I can recommend the following steps for an IT engineer to learn Redis:

1. Understand the basics: Start by reading about Redis and understanding the basic concepts, such as data structures, commands, configuration, persistence, and scalability. Consult the official Redis documentation for a comprehensive guide.

2. Experiment with Redis: Install Redis on your development environment, and experiment with the various commands and data structures. Redis has native support for several programming languages, such as Python, Java, and Node.js, so choose your preferred language and start building simple applications.

3. Learn advanced topics: Once you are comfortable with the basics, move on to more advanced topics, such as clustering, replication, transactions, Lua scripting, and pub/sub messaging. These will enable you to use Redis in real-world scenarios.

4. Read Redis use cases: To gain practical knowledge on how Redis is used in different industries, such as e-commerce, social media, gaming, and finance, read case studies, blogs, and whitepapers.

5. Join the community: Redis has a vibrant community of developers and users who are always eager to share their knowledge and experiences. Join Redis forums, attend meetups, conferences, and webinars, and collaborate on Redis GitHub projects to learn from others and contribute to the community.
