IT engineers should learn about logging and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) because it is essential for ensuring the security and health of an organization's technology infrastructure. By understanding logging and SIEM technology, IT engineers can identify and investigate potential threats and attacks to their systems and networks, and they can take proactive measures to prevent such issues from happening again. Logging and SIEM technology also allows IT engineers to monitor the performance of their systems, identify bottlenecks or issues in the infrastructure, and optimize system performance to ensure maximum availability. Therefore, IT engineers who are proficient in logging and SIEM technology are highly valued by organizations that prioritize the security and integrity of their technology assets.
