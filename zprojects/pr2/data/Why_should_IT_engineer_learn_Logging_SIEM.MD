IT engineers should learn logging SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) because it is a critical component of modern cybersecurity infrastructure. This technology allows organizations to collect, analyze, and respond to security-related events in real-time, helping to detect and prevent potential security breaches before they happen. By learning logging SIEM, IT engineers can better manage security incidents, identify potential threats to their organization's systems, and take proactive steps to mitigate those threats. This knowledge and expertise can help organizations better protect themselves from cyber attacks, which are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated in today's digital landscape.
