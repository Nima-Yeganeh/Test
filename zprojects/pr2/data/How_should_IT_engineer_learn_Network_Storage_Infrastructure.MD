As a chatbot, I can provide you with some guidance on how an IT engineer can learn network storage infrastructure:

1. Start with the basics: Before diving into network storage infrastructure, it's important to have a solid understanding of networking concepts. Learn about the OSI model, TCP/IP stack, VLANs, routing protocols, and other network fundamentals.

2. Familiarize yourself with different storage technologies: There are multiple storage technologies out there, including block storage, file storage, and object storage. Learn the key differences between each type and how they're used in the industry.

3. Get hands-on experience: Practice is key when it comes to learning network storage infrastructure. Set up a test environment, install different types of storage systems, and get comfortable working with storage protocols such as NFS, iSCSI, and SMB.

4. Study industry-specific certifications: Certifications such as EMC Storage Administrator (EMCSA) or NetApp Certified Data Administrator (NCDA) can provide valuable knowledge and skills to those looking to specialize in network storage infrastructure.

5. Keep up with industry trends: Network storage infrastructure is continually evolving, so it's important to stay up-to-date with new technologies and industry trends. Attend conferences, read industry blogs, and network with other professionals to learn about the latest developments in the field.
