IT engineers should learn Segment Routing because it is a networking technology that offers several benefits over traditional routing protocols. Some of the benefits of Segment Routing include:

1. Simple network designs: Segment routing eliminates the need for complex network designs by allowing network administrators to add service functions and paths on demand without configuring new protocols or making topology changes.

2. Improved scalability: With Segment Routing, network traffic is directed along a set of predetermined paths, which eliminates the need for complex computations and increases the scalability of the network.

3. Efficiency: Segment Routing allows network administrators to optimize traffic flow by steering it along the most efficient paths available.

4. Increased flexibility: Segment Routing allows for dynamic load balancing, which results in increased flexibility and better network performance.

5. Reduced network complexity: With Segment Routing, network complexity is reduced, which results in lower operational expenses and a more efficient network.

In conclusion, IT engineers should learn Segment Routing to enhance their network skills and keep up with the latest networking technology advancements.
