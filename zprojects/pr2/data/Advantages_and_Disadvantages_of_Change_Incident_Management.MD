Advantages of Change Incident Management:
1. Improved service quality: By implementing effective change and incident management processes, organizations can ensure that service disruptions are minimized and service quality is improved.

2. Faster incident resolution: With established incident management processes in place, organizations can resolve incidents more quickly, reducing downtime and minimizing the impact on users.

3. Better change management: Incident management can also improve change management processes, as it provides valuable feedback on the effectiveness of changes and helps to identify potential problems before they occur.

4. Increased accountability: With clear roles and responsibilities for incident management, organizations can ensure that everyone is accountable for the services they provide.

Disadvantages of Change Incident Management:

1. Risk of overcomplicating: Overcomplicating the incident and change management process can make it difficult for employees to understand and use, potentially leading to mistakes or delays.

2. Time-consuming: Implementing the incident and change management process can be time-consuming and require significant resources, particularly for larger organizations.

3. Resistance to change: Employees may be resistant to change, particularly if they feel that their roles and responsibilities are being changed without their input.

4. Lack of flexibility: Incident and change management processes can sometimes be rigid, which means they may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing circumstances or unexpected events.
