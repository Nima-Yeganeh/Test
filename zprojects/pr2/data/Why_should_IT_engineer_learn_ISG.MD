IT engineers should learn about Information Security Governance (ISG) because it ensures that the technology used by an organization is secure and protected against cyber threats. ISG is necessary for protecting an organization's sensitive data from being hacked or breached, ensuring the privacy of employees and customers, and maintaining the reputation of the organization. It also helps to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and reduces the risk of legal liability. By understanding ISG, IT engineers can contribute to the effective implementation of security measures and ensure that an organization's technology infrastructure is safe and secure.
