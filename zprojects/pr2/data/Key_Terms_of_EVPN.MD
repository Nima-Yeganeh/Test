EVPN stands for Ethernet Virtual Private Network. Key terms associated with EVPN include:

1. VXLAN - Virtual Extensible LAN is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate Layer 2 traffic in order to extend it across a Layer 3 network.

2. BGP - Border Gateway Protocol is a widely used exterior gateway protocol that exchanges routing information across the internet.

3. MAC learning - EVPN uses MAC address learning to discover the location of the remote MAC address.

4. Type 2 routes - EVPN uses Type 2 routes to distribute MAC reachability information across an MPLS or VXLAN network.

5. Ethernet segment - An Ethernet segment is a Layer 2 domain that can span one or more switches or routers.

6. IRB - Integrated Routing and Bridging enables communication between Layer 2 and Layer 3 domains.

7. Multicast - EVPN uses multicast to send broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) traffic to all the participating VXLAN Layer 3 gateways.
