Here are some tips and tricks for working with Cloudflare:

1. Use Cloudflare Firewall: You can create rules to block or allow traffic based on IP address, user agent, or even the country of origin.

2. Always enable SSL: One of the most important benefits of Cloudflare is the ability to encrypt your website traffic. Always enable SSL to protect your website visitors.

3. Enable caching: Cloudflare has built-in caching that can speed up your website load times. Make sure to enable caching and set appropriate expiration times.

4. Use Page Rules: Page Rules let you control how Cloudflare handles specific URLs on your website. You can use them to redirect URLs, add authentication, or control caching.

5. Monitor your website: Cloudflare provides a range of analytics tools that can help you monitor your website traffic, identify threats, and optimize your website performance.

6. Use Load Balancing: If you have multiple servers running your website, you can use Cloudflare Load Balancing to distribute traffic between them.

7. Setup DNS records: Before you can start using Cloudflare, you need to update your DNS records to point to Cloudflare. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully.

8. Use Workers: Cloudflare Workers allow you to run custom code on Cloudflare's servers. You can use them to add functionality to your website or even build serverless applications.

9. Consider Enterprise Plan: If you have a high-traffic website, you may want to consider upgrading to Cloudflare's Enterprise plan. It offers advanced features such as DDoS protection and 24x7 support.
