1. Table: A collection of related data items stored in rows and columns. 

2. Column: A single field or attribute in a database table. 

3. Row/Record: A single entity or tuple in a database table. 

4. Primary key: A unique identifier for a record in a table. 

5. Foreign key: A reference to a primary key in another table, used to establish a relationship between two tables. 

6. Index: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. 

7. Query: A request for information from a database, which can be used to retrieve or modify data. 

8. Join: A process in which two or more tables are combined based on a common column. 

9. Constraint: A rule that restricts the values that can be stored in a database table. 

10. Aggregate functions: Functions that perform calculations on multiple rows of data and return a single result, such as SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN.
