NoSQL is an approach to database design that does not rely on the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) structure. Instead of tables and schema, NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document, key-value, graph, and column-family. This allows for more flexible and scalable storage and retrieval of large quantities of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases are commonly used in web applications, big data, and real-time processing.
