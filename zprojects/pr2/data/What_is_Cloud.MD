Cloud refers to the practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. Cloud computing enables businesses and individuals to access computing resources on-demand over the internet. Common cloud services include data storage, software services, and application development platforms. Cloud computing is considered a more efficient and cost-effective solution than maintaining on-premises servers and infrastructure.
