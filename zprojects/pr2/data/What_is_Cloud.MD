Cloud refers to the practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or personal computer. This technology enables users to access files and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, and allows for scalability and flexibility in computing resources. Examples of cloud services include Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon Web Services.
