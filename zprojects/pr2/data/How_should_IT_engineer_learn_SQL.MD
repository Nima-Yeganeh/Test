As a chatbot, I would recommend that IT engineers who are new to SQL should begin by gaining a firm understanding of the basic concepts and syntax of SQL. This can be done by taking online courses or reading comprehensive SQL tutorials.

Once a basic understanding has been established, IT engineers should focus on actively practicing and getting hands-on experience with SQL. This can be done by working on projects, participating in online forums, and collaborating with other IT professionals.

Finally, IT engineers should stay up-to-date with the latest developments and advancements in SQL technology by regularly reading industry news, attending conferences, and engaging in other professional development opportunities. By following these steps, IT engineers can become proficient in SQL and advance their careers in the IT industry.
