As a chatbot, I can recommend several ways for an IT engineer to learn SQL:

1. Take an online course: There are many online platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or LinkedIn Learning that offer comprehensive SQL courses. These courses start from the basics of SQL and progress to advanced topics.

2. Read books: Many books are available in the market that can help you learn SQL. Books like SQL QuickStart Guide: The Simplified Beginner's Guide to Managing, Analyzing, and Manipulating Data With SQL are essential for beginners.

3. Practice: The more you practice SQL, the better IT engineer you become. There are several online practice websites available that offer exercises on SQL.

4. Attend workshops: Participating in SQL workshops or seminars can not only help you learn SQL but also empower you to share your SQL knowledge with others. 

5. Follow online resources: You can follow SQL blogs and forums to stay updated with the latest SQL trends and technologies.
