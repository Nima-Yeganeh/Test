IT engineers should learn Helm for various reasons, including:

1. Helm simplifies the process of packaging and deploying Kubernetes applications.

2. It enables IT engineers to automate complex deployment tasks and configure Kubernetes applications with ease.

3. Helm provides a standardized format for packaging and managing Kubernetes resources, making it easier to share and reuse application components across different teams and projects.

4. Helm can help IT engineers version control Kubernetes resources, making it possible to roll back to an earlier version of an application if necessary.

5. Helm enables IT engineers to manage dependencies and create charts that package multiple applications together, simplifying the deployment of complex distributed systems.

Overall, learning Helm can help IT engineers increase their efficiency, save time, and streamline the deployment process for Kubernetes applications.
