PPTP stands for Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, which is a protocol used for implementing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). It was a popular VPN protocol in the past but has now been largely replaced by more secure protocols like L2TP, IPSec, and OpenVPN. PPTP creates a secure connection between two devices by encapsulating PPP packets within IP packets and then transmitting them over the internet. It is used to enable remote users to securely access a corporate network by creating a virtual point-to-point connection.
