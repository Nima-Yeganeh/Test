VPLS, or Virtual Private LAN Service, is a network technology that enables multiple sites to connect over a wide area network (WAN) as if they are connected on the same local area network (LAN). This allows for seamless communication and data exchange between the sites, as if they are physically located in the same building. VPLS is often used by businesses with multiple offices or locations, as it simplifies network management and reduces the need for costly equipment and dedicated connections between sites.
