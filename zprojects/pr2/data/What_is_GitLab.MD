GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides source code management (SCM), continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and more. It allows individuals and teams to collaborate on projects, track issues and bugs, manage code reviews, and perform automated tests, all in one centralized platform. It is a popular alternative to GitHub for those who prefer self-hosted or on-premises solutions.
