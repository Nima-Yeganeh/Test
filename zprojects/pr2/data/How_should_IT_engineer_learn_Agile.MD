There are several ways that IT engineers can learn Agile methodology:

1. Take a training course: There are several training courses available that cover the basics of Agile. A popular one is Certified Scrum Master (CSM) course, which is offered by the Scrum Alliance.

2. Read books: There are several books available on Agile, including "Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" by Jeff Sutherland and "Agile Estimating and Planning" by Mike Cohn. These books can provide valuable insights into Agile practices.

3. Attend conferences: Attend Agile conferences and meetups, such as Agile2020 or Scrum.org. These events can provide great networking opportunities and give IT engineers a chance to learn from experts in the Agile community.

4. Practice with a team: IT engineers can start practicing Agile in their own team, by adopting Agile practices such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. This will help them gain hands-on experience and understand the benefits of Agile firsthand.
