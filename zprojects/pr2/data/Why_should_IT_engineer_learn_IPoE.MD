IT engineers should learn IPoE (IP over Ethernet) because it is a commonly used protocol in computer networking. It is used to provide IP addresses to devices on a network and facilitates communication between devices. Understanding IPoE is crucial for IT engineers who are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining networks. Without a thorough understanding of IPoE, IT engineers may not be able to troubleshoot network issues or properly configure network settings. Additionally, many IT professionals pursue certifications such as the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) or the CompTIA Network+ certification, both of which require an understanding of IPoE.
