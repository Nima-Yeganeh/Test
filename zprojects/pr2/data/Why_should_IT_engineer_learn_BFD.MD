IT engineers may benefit from learning BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) as it is a protocol that can improve the reliability and speed of network communications. BFD creates and maintains a low-overhead communication link between devices, allowing for quick detection of failures and rerouting of traffic to minimize downtime. By incorporating BFD into their systems, IT engineers may be able to improve network performance, reduce downtime, and increase overall network efficiency.
