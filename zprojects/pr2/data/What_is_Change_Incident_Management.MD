Change Incident Management (CIM) refers to the process of managing all changes in an organization's infrastructure and applications, and resolving any incidents that arise as a result of those changes. The goal of CIM is to minimize the negative impact of changes on the organization's operations and productivity by ensuring that all changes are planned, controlled, and tested prior to implementation. This includes identifying potential risks, evaluating the potential impact of changes, communicating changes to relevant stakeholders, and monitoring the change for any issues that may arise. In the event of an incident, CIM provides a structured approach to managing the incident and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible.
