Change incident management is a process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving incidents that occur as a result of changes made to an organization's IT infrastructure or applications. It involves managing the risks associated with changes and minimizing the impact of incidents that occur during the change process. This process helps ensure that changes are implemented smoothly and with minimal disruption to business operations. Change incident management is a critical part of the IT Service Management (ITSM) framework and is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of IT services.
