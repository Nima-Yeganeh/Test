Sure! Here are some tips and tricks when working with VMware:

1. Take advantage of snapshots: Snapshots can save you a lot of time and headaches. With snapshots, you can quickly revert back to a previous state of your virtual machine if anything goes wrong.

2. Use vCenter Server: If you are working with multiple virtual machines, it is much easier to manage them with vCenter Server. With vCenter Server, you can manage, monitor, and control all your virtual machines from a central location.

3. Allocate resources appropriately: When creating a new virtual machine, make sure to allocate the proper amount of CPU, memory and storage resources to it to avoid performance degradation.

4. Use VMware Tools: VMware Tools is a set of utilities and drivers that enhances the performance of your virtual machine. It also allows for better integration between the guest operating system and the host.

5. Backup your virtual machines regularly: It is important to back up your virtual machines regularly to prevent data loss due to hardware failures, viruses, or other disasters.

6. Make sure your host server is properly configured: It is important to make sure that your host server is properly configured for virtualization to ensure optimal performance of your virtual machines.

7. Customize your virtual machines: You can customize your virtual machines to better suit your specific needs. Some examples include changing the amount of memory or CPU resources, adding a new network adapter, or changing the virtual hardware version.

I hope these tips and tricks help!
