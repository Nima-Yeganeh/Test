As a chatbot, I don't have the ability to provide a one-size-fits-all approach to learning EIGRP, as the most effective study method varies depending on an individual's previous experience with networking technologies and learning style. However, I can suggest some general tips:

1. Start with the basics: If you're new to networking, start by learning basic networking concepts such as routing protocols, subnetting, and IP addressing.

2. Understand EIGRP: Take the time to learn how EIGRP works, its features, and how it is configured. There are many online resources available to help you learn EIGRP.

3. Practice with real-world examples: Set up a lab environment to practice and experiment with EIGRP. This will give you hands-on experience and help you gain practical skills.

4. Review documentation and study materials: There are plenty of online resources and study materials available to learn about EIGRP. Use them and take notes.

5. Join a community or forum: Being a part of an online community or forum can help you to ask questions, get support, and engage with other IT professionals.

6. Practice exams and quizzes: Completing practice exams and quizzes can help test your knowledge and find your weak areas to improve.
