1. Document database: A type of NoSQL database that stores data in JSON or BSON format.
2. Key-value database: A type of NoSQL database that stores data as key-value pairs.
3. Column-family database: A type of NoSQL database that stores data in column families rather than rows and columns.
4. Graph database: A type of NoSQL database that stores data in a graph structure consisting of nodes, edges, and properties.
5. CAP theorem: A concept that states that a distributed system can have only two of the following three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
6. Sharding: A method of distributing and partitioning data across multiple servers in a NoSQL database to ensure scalability and performance.
7. ACID: A set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
8. BASE: A set of properties that suggest how NoSQL databases should behave instead of adhering to the strict ACID properties: Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventual consistency.
