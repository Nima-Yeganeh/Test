NoSQL, or non-relational databases, is a broad category of database management systems that are designed to support large-scale, distributed data storage and processing. Some of the key terms associated with NoSQL databases include:

1. Document-oriented databases: NoSQL databases that store data in semi-structured documents, instead of tables with rows and columns.

2. Key-value stores: NoSQL databases that store data as a collection of key-value pairs, with a unique key identifying each value.

3. Column family stores: NoSQL databases that store data in column-oriented tables, which can result in faster querying and data retrieval.

4. Graph databases: NoSQL databases that store data in a network of interconnected nodes and edges.

5. CAP theorem: A theory in distributed computing that states that it is impossible for a distributed system to have all three of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

6. ACID vs BASE: Two different approaches to ensuring data consistency in a distributed system. ACID focuses on ensuring transactional consistency at all times, while BASE prioritizes availability and eventual consistency.

7. Sharding: The practice of dividing a database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, which can be distributed across multiple servers.
