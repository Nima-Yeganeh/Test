Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IAC) tool that enables developers to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative manner, meaning that you declare the desired end-state of your infrastructure and Terraform figures out how to get there. It helps automate the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure on various platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and many others. Terraform is widely used by DevOps engineers to build, change, and version their infrastructure in a repeatable and predictable way.
