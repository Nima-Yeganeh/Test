ISIS (Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System) is a routing protocol that is used in large-scale networks like ISP (Internet Service Provider) networks, data centers, and enterprise networks. IT engineers should consider learning ISIS routing because:

1. Scalability: ISIS is highly scalable and can support very large networks with hundreds of routers and thousands of subnets. Due to its ability to handle larger networks, it is often used by internet service providers (ISPs) and other large organizations.

2. Fast convergence: ISIS has a fast convergence time, meaning networks can recover quickly from a failure, reducing downtime and improving network uptime.

3. Stability: ISIS is a stable routing protocol that provides consistent network topologies, reducing the likelihood of routing loops and other network issues.

4. Support: ISIS is widely supported by many network vendors and is an industry-standard protocol, which means it is commonly seen across many different organizations.

5. Flexibility: ISIS supports both IP and non-IP protocols, making it a flexible choice for networks that use multiple protocols.

In summary, learning ISIS routing allows IT engineers to become proficient in a protocol that is highly scalable, quick, stable, supported, and flexible.
