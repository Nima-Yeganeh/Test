Redis is an in-memory data store that is used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is open-source and provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Redis is fast and efficient as it stores data in memory and can persist data on disk as well. It is often used as a backend for web applications, primarily for caching frequently accessed data. Additionally, it has features for real-time messaging, pub/sub messaging, and geospatial indexing.
