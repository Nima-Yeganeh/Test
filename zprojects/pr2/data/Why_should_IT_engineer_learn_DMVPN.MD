IT engineers may want to learn about DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN) for several reasons, such as:

1. Scalability: DMVPN is a scalable solution that allows businesses to connect multiple branch offices and remote workers together in a single network.

2. Cost-effective: DMVPN allows businesses to use the public internet as a transport mechanism, which can be more cost-effective than using dedicated lines or MPLS networks.

3. Security: DMVPN can offer strong security measures by using IPsec encryption and authentication protocols.

4. Flexibility: With DMVPN, IT engineers can set up virtual private networks quickly and easily, making it a flexible solution for businesses.

5. Performance: DMVPN can provide efficient routing, faster data transfer rates and improved QoS (quality of service) for voice and video applications.

Overall, learning about DMVPN can help IT engineers to understand how to build and optimize large-scale VPNs that are secure, efficient, and cost-effective.
