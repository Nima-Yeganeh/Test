IT engineers should learn MAP-T (Mapping of Address and Port with Translation) because it is a crucial technology used in modern-day networking. MAP-T facilitates the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 addressing, which is important because the number of available IPv4 addresses is rapidly decreasing. MAP-T allows for the seamless integration of IPv6 into existing IPv4 networks, while still allowing IPv4 devices to communicate with IPv6 devices. By learning MAP-T, IT engineers can help organizations to mitigate the risks associated with the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, improve network performance and security, and ensure that their network infrastructure is future-proofed for years to come.
