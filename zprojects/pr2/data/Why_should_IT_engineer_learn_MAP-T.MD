IT engineers should learn MAP-T because it is a technology protocol that enables the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. As the number of devices on the internet continues to grow, the IPv4 protocol is running out of unique IP addresses, while IPv6 provides a much larger pool of addresses that can accommodate the growth. MAP-T provides a way for IPv4-only devices to communicate with IPv6-only devices, making it an important protocol for engineers who want to keep up with the latest developments in networking technology. Additionally, IPv6 provides improved security and efficiency features compared to IPv4, so learning MAP-T and IPv6 can help engineers better meet the needs of their clients and organizations.
