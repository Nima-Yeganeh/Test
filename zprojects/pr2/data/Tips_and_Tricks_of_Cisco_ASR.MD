The Cisco ASR is a series of routers designed for service providers and enterprise networks. Here are some tips and tricks for working with Cisco ASR: 

1. Configure Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure high-priority traffic receives adequate bandwidth and low-priority traffic does not degrade performance for critical applications. 
2. Implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to secure data transmission between different networks. 
3. Utilize modular design features to simplify configuration and maintenance of the network. 
4. Use Network Address Translation (NAT) to conceal private IP addresses from the public network. 
5. Configure advanced traffic engineering features, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Traffic Engineering (TE), to optimize traffic flow and reduce network congestion. 
6. Maintain regular firmware updates to ensure that the router benefits from the latest security patches and features. 
7. Utilize redundant power supplies and fans to increase router reliability. 
8. Take advantage of available analytical tools, like Cisco Prime or NetFlow, to monitor and troubleshoot device performance.
