Cisco ASR (Aggregation Services Router) is a powerful routing platform that delivers high-performance, reliability, and scalability for service provider and enterprise networks. Below are some tips and tricks of Cisco ASR:

1. Use redundant power supplies to prevent downtime.

2. Use the virtual port-channel (vPC) feature to provide redundancy and load balancing between switches.

3. Configure automatic failover using iOS IP SLAs.

4. Use the Quality of Service (QoS) feature to prioritize traffic and ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth they need.

5. Use NetFlow to monitor network traffic and identify issues or potential threats.

6. Utilize advanced routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to optimize routing and prevent traffic disruptions.

7. Use the Cisco IOS firewall feature to protect against network attacks and unauthorized access.

8. Implement Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services across the network.

9. Use the MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) feature to improve network performance and reduce latency.

10. Upgrade the firmware and software regularly to ensure optimal performance and security.
