SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) is a high-speed fiber-optic network technology that was developed to transmit large amounts of data over long distances. It was first standardized in the United States by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in the mid-1980s, and later internationally by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). SONET defines a standardized communications protocol and physical interface for optical transmission, enabling high-speed communication of voice, data, and video signals over optical fiber cables. With SONET, data rates can range from less than 50 Mbps to more than 40 Gbps. SONET is commonly used in telecommunications networks, such as those operated by telephone companies, and in other high-bandwidth applications.
