BGP stands for Border Gateway Protocol. It is an internet protocol that is used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems (AS). BGP allows routers to communicate with each other and determine the best paths for packets to travel between networks. It is commonly used by internet service providers (ISPs) and large organizations to connect their networks to other networks on the internet. BGP is a critical component of the internet, as it enables global connectivity and routing of internet traffic.
