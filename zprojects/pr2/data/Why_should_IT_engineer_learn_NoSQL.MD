IT engineers should learn NoSQL because it is a database technology used for handling large-scale, high-throughput, and unstructured data. NoSQL databases allow for flexibility in data modeling, faster data access, and easier horizontal scalability. As more and more organizations move towards using big data technologies, understanding NoSQL can be extremely valuable for IT engineers in terms of managing data and designing effective systems. Additionally, many modern applications are designed to work with NoSQL databases, so IT engineers looking to build their knowledge and skillset should familiarize themselves with this technology.
