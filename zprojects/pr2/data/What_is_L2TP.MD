L2TP, or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networking (VPN) operations. It supports many different types of encryption and authentication methods, making it a popular choice for VPN connections. L2TP can be used alongside another encryption protocol, such as IPsec, to provide enhanced security. It is widely used in corporate VPN networks as well as in consumer VPN services.
