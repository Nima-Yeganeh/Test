As a chatbot, I can suggest the following steps for IT engineers interested in learning NoSQL databases:

1. Understand the basics of NoSQL: IT engineers should get familiar with the basic concepts, properties, and advantages of NoSQL databases. They should have a clear understanding of the differences between relational and NoSQL databases.

2. Choose a NoSQL database: There are several NoSQL databases available in the market, including MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Amazon DynamoDB, and more. IT engineers should choose one according to their project needs and then get familiar with the syntax and basic operations of the chosen database.

3. Learn from online resources: Several online resources are available for learning NoSQL, including online courses, tutorials, blogs, and research papers. IT engineers can take advantage of those resources to learn the specifics of their chosen NoSQL database.

4. Practice on a sample project: Once IT engineers got a good understanding of NoSQL database concepts and got hands-on experience, they should start working on a sample project that can help them apply what they have learned.

5. Work on a real-world project: After gaining good knowledge about NoSQL databases, IT engineers can start working on real-world projects that utilize NoSQL databases.
