IT engineers should learn Ubuntu for several reasons:

1. Ubuntu is a widely-used operating system, especially in the server space. Many companies use Ubuntu for their servers because it is stable, secure, and flexible.

2. Ubuntu is an open-source operating system, which means that it is free to download and use. This can be particularly beneficial for small businesses or non-profits that may have limited IT budgets.

3. Ubuntu is a user-friendly operating system. It is designed with ease-of-use in mind, and many of the tasks that IT engineers will need to carry out can be done through a graphical user interface.

4. Ubuntu has a large community of developers and users who can provide support and guidance. This can be particularly valuable for IT engineers who are new to the platform.

5. Finally, learning Ubuntu can help IT engineers improve their Linux skills. It is a popular distribution and is very similar to other Linux-based operating systems, so the skills learned on Ubuntu can be easily transferred to other Linux distributions.
