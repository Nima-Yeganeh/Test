IT engineers should learn about OLT (Optical Line Terminal) and ONT (Optical Network Terminal) because they are the key components of the optical fiber network. OLT is used in the central office and ONT is used in the customer premises, and together they make up the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network. 

By learning about OLT and ONT, IT engineers can understand how the network works and how to troubleshoot any issues that might arise. They can also gain knowledge about the latest technologies and advancements in the field, which can help them in their professional growth and development. Additionally, since fiber optic networks are becoming increasingly popular for high-speed Internet and telecommunications services, IT engineers with expertise in OLT and ONT will become more in demand in the industry.
