CGNAT or Carrier Grade Network Address Translation is a process used by internet service providers to conserve IPv4 addresses. Here are some tips and tricks for dealing with CGNAT:

1. Use a VPN: A VPN can help you bypass CGNAT, as it creates a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. This way, your device can access the internet via the VPN's IP address, which is not blocked by CGNAT.

2. Use IPv6: As the world is moving towards IPv6, more and more internet service providers are adopting it. IPv6 has abundant address space, reducing the need for CGNAT.

3. Use port forwarding: CGNAT blocks incoming connections, making it challenging to host a server or run certain applications. However, with port forwarding, you can direct incoming traffic to a particular IP address and port so that your device can receive it.

4. Contact your ISP: If you're having persistent issues with CGNAT, your ISP may be able to help. Some ISPs offer a public IP address service, which enables you to have a unique IPv4 address even though the ISP is using CGNAT.

5. Try a different ISP: If your current ISP is using CGNAT, consider switching to an ISP that provides a public IP address, or better yet, uses IPv6 instead of CGNAT.
