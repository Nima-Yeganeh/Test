Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that helps system administrators automate the process of configuring and managing servers. It allows organizations to define and enforce a desired state configuration for their infrastructure using a declarative language. This makes it easier to manage large, complex environments, ensuring consistency, reliability, and scalability. Puppet can be used to manage all aspects of a server's configuration, from operating system settings to application stacks and security policies.
