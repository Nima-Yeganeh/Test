Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that helps automate the deployment and management of software and IT infrastructure. It allows organizations to use a declarative language to define the desired state of their IT infrastructure, which Puppet then uses to automatically configure and maintain systems, applications, and services. Puppet uses a client-server model, where a Puppet master server distributes the configurations to Puppet agents on target systems.
