IT engineers should learn NAS (Network Attached Storage) because it is an efficient and cost-effective way of storing and managing data. NAS allows multiple clients to access the same storage device over a network, without the need for a dedicated server. This means IT engineers can set up a centralized storage system, which can be accessed by different users and devices from different locations. Additionally, NAS provides data redundancy and backups, which ensures that vital data is not lost in case of hardware failure. Therefore, learning about NAS can help IT engineers to design, implement and maintain secure and efficient storage solutions for businesses and organizations.
