L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks (VPNs). Some key terms associated with L2TP include:

1. Tunnel: The secure channel created between two devices for communication.

2. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): The communication protocol used by L2TP to authenticate and establish a secure channel.

3. Access concentrator (LAC): The device that initiates the L2TP tunnel on the user's end.

4. Network server (LNS): The device that terminates the L2TP tunnel on the service provider's end.

5. Control connection: The connection established between the LAC and LNS for control messages.

6. Data connection: The connection established within the control connection for transmitting data.

7. Session ID: The identifier assigned to each L2TP session to differentiate it from other sessions.

8. Call ID: The identifier assigned to each call within an L2TP session for demultiplexing multiple calls over a single tunnel.
