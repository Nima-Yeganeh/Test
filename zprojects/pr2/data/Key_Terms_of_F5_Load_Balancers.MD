1. Load Balancing: The process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers in a server farm, to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time and avoid overloading any single resource.

2. Application Delivery Controllers (ADC): An advanced form of load balancer, that includes additional features such as SSL offloading, caching, compression, and content switching.

3. Virtual IP (VIP): A unique IP address that is assigned to a virtual server or pool in F5 load balancers.

4. Nodes: The physical servers that are members of a server pool in F5 load balancers.

5. Pool: A group of two or more servers that work together to serve client requests in F5 load balancers.

6. Persistence: The ability of the F5 load balancer to direct a client's request to the same server that it previously communicated with, based on a range of criteria such as client IP address, SSL session ID, cookie values, etc.

7. Health Monitor: A test that is performed by the F5 Load balancer to periodically check the status of each server in a pool, to ensure it is available and fully operational.

8. iRules: Custom scripts in the F5 load balancer that allow users to programmatically manipulate traffic based on various conditions and actions.

9. SSL Offloading: A feature in the F5 load balancer that enables the decryption of SSL traffic before it reaches the backend servers, which reduces the workload of the servers and enhances security. 

10. Traffic management: The process of controlling and optimizing traffic flows between clients and servers in F5 load balancers, based on factors such as performance, availability, and security.
