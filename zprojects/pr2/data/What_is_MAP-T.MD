MAP-T stands for "Mapping of Address and Port with Translation" and is a technology used in IPv6 transitioning scenarios. It is a mechanism that allows IPv6 traffic to pass through an IPv4 network by translating the IPv6 traffic into IPv4 traffic at the network border. This is achieved by assigning an IPv4 address and port to each IPv6 address, which allows the traffic to be routed through an IPv4 network without loss of functionality. MAP-T is one of several IPv6 transition technologies that are used to facilitate the migration from IPv4 to IPv6.
