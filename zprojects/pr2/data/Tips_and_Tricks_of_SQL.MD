Here are some tips and tricks for SQL that you might find helpful:

1. Use aliases: Aliases are a way to give a table or column a temporary name that is easier to read and type. For example: 

```SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName FROM Customers AS c```

2. Use wildcard characters: Wildcard characters can be used to match patterns in data. For example: 

```SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'```

This would return all customers whose names start with the letter 'a'.

3. Use the IN operator: The IN operator can be used to specify a list of values to match against. For example: 

```SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'Mexico')```

This would return all customers who are from either the USA, Canada, or Mexico.

4. Use subqueries: Subqueries can be used to find information that is not directly available in a table. For example: 

```SELECT CustomerName, OrderID FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders)```

This would return the customer name and order ID of all customers who have placed an order.

5. Use functions: Functions can be used to perform calculations or manipulate data. For example: 

```SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products```

This would return the average price of all products in the Products table.

6. Use the HAVING clause: The HAVING clause is used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to filter the results of a query based on aggregate values. For example: 

```SELECT CategoryID, AVG(Price) FROM Products GROUP BY CategoryID HAVING AVG(Price) > 100```

This would return the category ID and average price for all categories where the average price is greater than $100.

7. Use the ORDER BY clause: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order. For example: 

```SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC```

This would return all customers sorted first by country in ascending order, then by customer name in descending order.
