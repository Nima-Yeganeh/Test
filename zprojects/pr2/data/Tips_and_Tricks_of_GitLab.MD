Sure, here are some tips and tricks of GitLab:

1. Use GitLab CI/CD for automated testing and deployment: GitLab has an integrated CI/CD pipeline that allows you to automate your testing and deployment processes. By creating a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your project repository, you can define pipelines that build, test, and deploy your code. This helps ensure that changes are thoroughly tested before they are deployed to production.

2. Take advantage of GitLab's merge request (MR) feature: MRs allow you to propose changes to a project and collaborate with other developers. They also provide a way to review and discuss changes before they are merged into the main codebase. Use MRs regularly to solicit feedback and to ensure code quality.

3. Use GitLab's issue tracking feature for project management: GitLab's issue tracking feature allows you to create and track issues, bugs, and feature requests. Use the issue tracker to keep track of project milestones, manage workloads, and assign tasks to team members.

4. Use GitLab snippets to share code: GitLab snippets are a great way to share code snippets with team members. Use snippets to share code examples, troubleshoot issues, or share snippets of code that you find useful.

5. Customize your GitLab instance with customizations: GitLab allows you to customize many aspects of your instance, including webhooks, project templates, and themes. Take advantage of these customizations to make GitLab work best for your team's needs. 

6. Use GitLab's wiki feature to document project information: GitLab's wiki feature allows you to create and share project documentation, such as setup guides, API documentation, or user manuals. Use the wiki to ensure team members have access to important information about the project. 

7. Explore GitLab's integrations with other tools: GitLab has integrations with many other tools, such as Slack, Jira, and Jenkins. Explore these integrations to see how they can help improve your workflow and enhance your team's productivity.
