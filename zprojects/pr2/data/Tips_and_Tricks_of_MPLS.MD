MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) is a technique used in modern network architecture, which can be really beneficial in delivering high-performance, scalable, and secure communication. Here are some tips and tricks for MPLS:

1. Labeling: MPLS uses labeling to forward data packets through a network. Ensure that the labeling process is flexible enough to suit your network architecture and requirements.

2. Traffic Engineering: MPLS has built-in traffic engineering features that enhance network performance and help in the delivery of high-priority traffic.

3. QoS: Quality of Service (QoS) is an essential MPLS feature that prioritizes data traffic based on importance and urgency.

4. Network Resiliency: Using MPLS, network resiliency can be improved through the use of backup paths or alternate routing.

5. VPN: MPLS is widely used as a solution for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which can be used to extend a private network over a public one.

6. MPLS VPN Encryption: Never forget to encrypt the MPLS VPN traffic, ensuring privacy and security for the network's users.

7. Monitoring and Provisioning: To ensure a solid MPLS performance, monitoring and provisioning tools should be in place to keep track of network performance and ensure proper scaling of the network.

8. Testing: Testing the MPLS network before deployment is crucial to ensure optimal behavior and compatibility with other systems.
