Puppet is a configuration management tool that automates the deployment and management of software and infrastructure. Here are some key terms used in Puppet:

1. Node: This refers to a machine or server that is managed by Puppet.

2. Resource: This is the basic unit of configuration in Puppet. It represents a piece of software or infrastructure that Puppet is responsible for managing.

3. Manifest: This is a file that contains the configuration code for Puppet. It defines the resources that Puppet will manage on a node.

4. Module: This is a collection of manifests and associated files that can be used to manage a specific piece of software or infrastructure.

5. Agent: This is the software that runs on a node and communicates with the Puppet master to retrieve configuration information and apply it to the node.

6. Puppet master: This is the central management server that stores the configuration information and sends it to the agents on the managed nodes.

7. Facts: These are pieces of information about the node, such as its hostname, IP address, and operating system, that can be used by Puppet to make decisions about how to manage the node.
