EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol. Some key terms related to EIGRP include:

1. Autonomous System (AS): In EIGRP, an AS is a collection of routers that operate under the same administrative domain and share the same routing protocol.

2. Neighbor: A neighbor is a router that shares common EIGRP configuration information, such as autonomous system (AS) number, hello and hold timer values, and metric calculation methods.

3. Feasible Successor: In EIGRP, a feasible successor is a backup route that can be used if the primary route fails. A feasible successor is determined by selecting the best route through a neighbor other than the current successor.

4. Metric: The metric in EIGRP is a calculated value that reflects the cost of reaching a destination. EIGRP uses several parameters, including bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and MTU to calculate the metric.

5. Topology Table: The topology table, also known as the routing table or the DUAL table, is a database that stores information about the network topology, routes, and metrics learned from EIGRP neighbors.

6. Successor: In EIGRP, the successor is the best route to a destination that has been selected based on the lowest metric. The router sends traffic to the successor route.

7. Routing Information Protocol (RIP): EIGRP can interoperate with other routing protocols, such as RIP. When EIGRP receives an update from RIP, it converts it to an EIGRP update and updates its own topology table.
