There are several ways for an IT engineer to learn about storage area networks (SANs). Here are some recommended steps:

1. Learn the basics of storage: Before diving into SANs, it's important to understand the fundamentals of storage in general. Learn about different types of storage devices and their architectures, storage protocols, and data management.

2. Study SAN architectures: Understand the building blocks of a SAN, such as the storage devices, switches, and host bus adapters (HBAs). Study the different types of SAN architectures, such as Fiber Channel SAN, iSCSI, and FCoE.

3. Get hands-on experience: Setting up and configuring a SAN is a great way to gain hands-on experience. Consider setting up a small SAN in a lab environment or working on a SAN project at work.

4. Attend training courses: There are many training courses available that can help you gain a deeper understanding of SANs. Consider taking courses from vendors like EMC, NetApp, or HP, or taking online courses.

5. Join a SAN community: Joining a SAN community or forum can be extremely helpful in learning about SANs and troubleshooting issues. These communities often have experts who can provide advice and guidance.
