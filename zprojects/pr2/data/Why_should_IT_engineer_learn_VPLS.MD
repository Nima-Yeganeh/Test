IT engineers should learn Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS) to provide secure and efficient interconnectivity between different sites of an organization. VPLS is a layer 2 VPN technology that offers secure point-to-point connections, and it allows IT engineers to extend a LAN connection between different locations. VPLS technology provides a flexible and scalable solution for business networks, and it can be used to support multiple services including voice, video, and data. Therefore, understanding VPLS will give IT engineers the ability to design and implement secure and efficient networks that can meet the specific needs of an organization.
