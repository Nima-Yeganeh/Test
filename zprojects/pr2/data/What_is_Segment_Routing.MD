Segment Routing (SR) is a network technology that enables flexible and efficient packet routing by directing traffic along specific paths through the network. It uses a simplified routing scheme that is easily programmed and managed through a traffic engineering function called Traffic Engineering (TE). In an SR network, each packet is tagged with a segment identifier, which indicates the path that it should follow to reach its destination. This allows the network operator to set up specific paths for traffic to take, which can optimize network resources and improve network performance. SR is becoming increasingly popular as a way to manage the growing complexity of modern networks and provide more granular control over traffic flow.
