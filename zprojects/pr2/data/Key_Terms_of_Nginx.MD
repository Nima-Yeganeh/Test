Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server. Some key terms associated with Nginx are: 

1. Server Blocks: Server blocks, also known as virtual hosts, are used to serve multiple websites or applications on the same server.

2. Reverse Proxy: Nginx can act as a reverse proxy, which means it can receive requests from clients and forward them to another server.

3. Load Balancing: Using Nginx as a load balancer ensures that traffic is evenly distributed between multiple servers to improve performance and avoid overload.

4. SSL Certificates: SSL certificates are used to secure websites with HTTPS protocol. Nginx supports SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.

5. Caching: Nginx has a built-in caching feature that helps store frequently accessed content and deliver it to clients quickly.

6. Access Logs: Nginx can keep track of access logs, which are records of HTTP requests made to the server. These records can help troubleshoot issues and monitor server performance.

7. Modules: Nginx supports custom modules that can be used to extend its functionality and improve performance.
