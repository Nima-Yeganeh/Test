As a chatbot, I can offer some suggestions on how an IT engineer could learn Puppet, a popular open-source configuration management tool. Here are some steps the engineer could follow:

1. Start with the official documentation: The Puppet website has excellent documentation and tutorials that are perfect for beginners. The documentation covers everything from basic installation to advanced topics like writing custom modules.

2. Attend training courses: Puppet offers a range of training courses that will help IT engineers learn how to use Puppet effectively. These courses can be either on-site or online.

3. Join online communities: IT engineers can join online communities like the Puppet User Group or Puppet Slack to interact with other Puppet users and get help with troubleshooting.

4. Setup a test environment: Engineers can set up a test environment with Puppet to learn how it works in a safe and controlled environment.

5. Use Puppet modules: There are many pre-built Puppet modules available that engineers can use to manage infrastructure more efficiently. it is a good practice to start with readily available modules.

6. Practice, Practice, Practice: IT engineers need practice to gain confidence in Puppet. Practicing on non-production environment will help engineers to bring their A-game once the time comes to implement on a high-value production environment. 

By following these steps, an IT engineer can quickly learn Puppet and start managing infrastructure with ease.
