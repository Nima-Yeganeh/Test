Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes which helps with the installation, upgrading, and managing of applications on a Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to define and manage your Kubernetes applications as charts, which are a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. Helm also provides a way to manage the complexity of Kubernetes configuration by enhancing the cluster with reusable, customizable deployments that can be easily installed and maintained.
