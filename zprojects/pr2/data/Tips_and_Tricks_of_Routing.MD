Routing is the process of selecting the best path for network traffic to travel from one host to another. Here are some tips and tricks for routing:

1. Understand your network topology: To optimize routing, it is important to understand the topology of your network. This includes the physical layout of devices, the logical connections between them, and the routing protocols in use.

2. Use a routing protocol: Routing protocols are designed to help automate the process of route selection and advertisement. Common routing protocols include OSPF, BGP, and RIP.

3. Implement redundancy: Network failures can happen, so it is important to have redundancy built into your routing architecture. This might include redundant links, routers, or even multiple ISPs.

4. Configure Quality of Service (QoS): QoS can be used to prioritize certain types of traffic over others. For example, you might want to prioritize VoIP traffic over web browsing traffic.

5. Monitor and analyze network traffic: Monitoring and analysis tools can help you identify bottleneck areas and adjust your routing accordingly.

6. Consider software-defined networking (SDN): SDN allows you to manage network traffic centrally, which can simplify and optimize your routing architecture. 

By following these tips and tricks, you can improve the speed, efficiency, and reliability of your network routing.
