As a chatbot, I can provide some general tips and tricks for routing:

1. Know the network topology: It's important to have a clear understanding of the network topology, including the location of routers, switches, and other networking devices. This will help you identify potential bottlenecks and make more informed routing decisions.

2. Use routing protocols: Routing protocols, like OSPF and BGP, can help automate the process of finding the best path for packets to travel. These protocols use various metrics, like bandwidth and delay, to determine the optimal route.

3. Implement QoS: Quality of Service (QoS) can help ensure that critical traffic, like voice and video, gets priority over other types of traffic. This can be achieved through techniques like traffic shaping and bandwidth allocation.

4. Monitor network performance: Regularly monitoring network performance can help you identify issues before they become major problems. Tools like network analyzers can help you track bandwidth utilization, packet loss, and other key metrics.

5. Plan for redundancy: In case of a router failure or other network outage, it's important to have redundancy built into the network. This can be achieved through techniques like load balancing and redundant paths.

Remember, effective routing is essential to a well-functioning network. By following these tips and tricks, you can help ensure that your network is fast, reliable, and efficient.
