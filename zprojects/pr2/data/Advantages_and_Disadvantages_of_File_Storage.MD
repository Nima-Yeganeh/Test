Advantages of File Storage:
1. Easy Access: With file storage, users can easily access their files from anywhere and anytime as long as they have an internet connection.
2. Secure Data Backup: File storage ensures that your data is backed up and secure, reducing the risk of data loss caused by system crashes or other unexpected events.
3. Collaborative Work: File storage enables multiple users to access and collaborate on the same files, which improves productivity and encourages teamwork.
4. Increases Space: File storage allows you to store larger files that may not fit on your hard drive, increasing your available storage space.
5. Cost-Effective: In comparison to local storage methods, file storage is often less expensive, especially when you consider the cost of hardware and maintenance.

Disadvantages of File Storage:
1. Internet Dependence: The need for an internet connection may limit accessibility for some users.
2. Security Breaches: File storage can be vulnerable to security breaches, and your files may be at risk of being hacked or compromised.
3. Dependence on Service Provider: File storage services are dependent on the service provider. Changes in the provider's policies or service reliability may affect access to your files.
4. Limited Customization: File storage may have limited customization options for the user interface or folder hierarchy.
5. Data Transfer Speed: Depending on internet speed and file size, data transfer times may be slow, making file storage less practical for large file transfers.
