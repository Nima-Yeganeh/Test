Sure! Here are some tips and tricks of SaltStack:

1. Use Salt States: Salt States are essential for complex configurations. A state file is written in YAML format and includes all the tasks you want SaltStack to execute on a particular system.

2. Utilize Salt Pillar: A Salt Pillar is a set of data that can be securely stored in an external data store and accessed by Salt in real-time. Pillar data can be used to store sensitive data and secrets.

3. Use Salt Cloud: Salt cloud is a feature in SaltStack that enables you to manage and provision cloud servers. Salt cloud can be used with various cloud service providers such as AWS, OpenStack, Google Cloud, and more.

4. Use Salt SSH: Salt SSH is a feature of SaltStack that allows you to run Salt commands over SSH. This means you can manage machines that do not have a Salt minion installed.

5. Develop Custom Modules: SaltStack allows you to write custom modules that extend Salt's functionality. Use these modules to automate tasks specific to your infrastructure.

6. Salt Mine: Salt Mine is used to collect data from the minions and store it in the master. You can use this data to make configuration decisions or get a holistic view of the infrastructure.

I hope these tips help!
