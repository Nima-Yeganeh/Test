IT engineers may need to learn about CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT) because it is a technology that is often used by internet service providers to conserve IPv4 addressing space. With the depletion of IPv4 addresses, CGNAT has become more widely used as a means of providing internet connectivity to large numbers of users while also handing out unique IP addresses. As an IT engineer, understanding CGNAT can help you troubleshoot network issues, design more efficient networks, and ensure that your organization's systems work seamlessly with CGNAT-based networks. Additionally, CGNAT presents unique security challenges that IT engineers should be aware of and learn how to mitigate.
