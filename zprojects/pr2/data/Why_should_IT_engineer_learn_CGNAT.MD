There are several reasons why IT engineers should learn about CGNAT:

1. Address exhaustion: With the depletion of IPv4 addresses, CGNAT is becoming increasingly popular as a solution to the problem of address exhaustion.

2. Network scalability: CGNAT allows network engineers to conserve public IPv4 addresses by translating private IP addresses to public IP addresses on the fly.

3. Security: CGNAT can provide an extra layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from the outside world.

4. Cost-effectiveness: CGNAT can be a cost-effective alternative to acquiring additional public IP addresses.

5. Regulatory compliance: Businesses may require the use of CGNAT to comply with certain regulations or policies related to IP address allocation.

In short, by learning about CGNAT, IT engineers can expand their knowledge and gain a valuable skill that can be of great value to businesses and organizations that are looking to optimize their networks.
