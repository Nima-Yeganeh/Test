DMVPN, which stands for Dynamic Multipoint VPN, is a Cisco technology used to provide a secure, scalable, and easy-to-manage VPN solution. Some of the key terms used in DMVPN are:

1. Hub: The central VPN device that acts as a hub in a DMVPN network.

2. Spoke: The remote VPN devices that connect to the hub in a DMVPN network.

3. NHRP: Next Hop Resolution Protocol is used to map the spoke devices to their IP addresses.

4. mGRE: Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation is a tunneling protocol that is used to transport data between the hub and spokes.

5. Routing Protocol: DMVPN supports different routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP to exchange routing information between the hub and spokes.

6. Phase: DMVPN is deployed in three phases - Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, each with different features and functionalities.

7. Overlay: DMVPN creates a virtual overlay network over the existing physical network to provide a secure and scalable solution.
