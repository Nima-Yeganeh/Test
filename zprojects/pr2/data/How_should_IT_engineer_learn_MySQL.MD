There are a variety of ways IT engineers can learn MySQL, but here are a few suggestions:

1. Take an online course: Websites like Udemy, Coursera, and Codecademy offer MySQL courses that are suitable for beginners and intermediate-level learners.

2. Read a book: A good MySQL book can take you through the fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in a more structured manner. Some recommended books include "MySQL Cookbook" by DuBois, "High Performance MySQL: Optimization, Backups, and Replication" by Schwartz and Zaitsev, and "Learning MySQL" by Widenius, Axmark, and Thacker.

3. Practice with a sandbox environment: You can gain valuable experience by setting up a MySQL environment and playing around with the software yourself. MySQL offers a free community edition for testing purposes. As part of your practice, you can create databases, tables, and queries. Also, perform backups, restores, and monitoring.

4. Attend a training class: Paid training classes offered by experts can provide you with hands-on experience and more in-depth coverage of the MySQL features and capabilities.

Ultimately, the best approach is to try several different methods and determine which one works best for you.
