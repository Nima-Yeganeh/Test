To learn PPPoE, an IT engineer should:

1. Understand the basics of TCP/IP networking protocols.

2. Study the PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) protocol and its different types of authentication methods such as PAP and CHAP.

3. Learn the PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) protocol and its components such as PADI (PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation), PADO (PPPoE Active Discovery Offer), PADR (PPPoE Active Discovery Request), and PADS (PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation).

4. Gain knowledge on how to configure PPPoE on network devices such as routers and switches.

5. Practice setting up a PPPoE connection and troubleshooting any issues that might arise.

6. Stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments and trends in PPPoE technology. 

There are many online resources that can help an IT engineer learn PPPoE, including blogs, online forums, and video tutorials. Additionally, IT engineers can attend training courses or certification programs to gain further expertise in PPPoE and related networking technologies.
