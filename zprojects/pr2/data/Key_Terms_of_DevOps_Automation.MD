Some key terms and concepts related to DevOps automation include:

1. Continuous Integration (CI): the practice of continually integrating code changes to a shared repository and automatically building and testing the changes to ensure they don't break the existing codebase.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD): the practice of automatically deploying code changes that have passed through the CI process to production environments.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): the practice of treating infrastructure like code by maintaining infrastructure configuration in version control and automating infrastructure provisioning and deployment.

4. Test Automation: the practice of automating software tests to ensure that code changes don't introduce new bugs or regressions.

5. Configuration Management: the practice of automating the deployment of software configurations to servers and other infrastructure components.

6. Deployment Pipelines: an automated sequence of steps that take place from code commit to deployment, including building, testing, and deploying code changes.

7. Monitoring and Logging: the practice of using automated tools to monitor the health and performance of production environments, as well as collect and analyze logs to troubleshoot issues.
