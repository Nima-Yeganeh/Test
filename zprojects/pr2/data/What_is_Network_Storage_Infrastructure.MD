Network storage infrastructure refers to the hardware and software components that are used to store and manage data across a network. This infrastructure typically includes storage devices, such as servers and storage arrays, as well as network protocols and management software for controlling access to data and ensuring data security. The goal of network storage infrastructure is to provide high-speed, reliable, and secure access to data for users across the network, while also providing centralized administration and control over storage resources.
