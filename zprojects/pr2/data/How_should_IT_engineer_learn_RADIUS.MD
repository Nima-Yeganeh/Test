An IT engineer can learn RADIUS by following these steps:

1. Understand what RADIUS is: RADIUS is a protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who need access to network resources.

2. Study the RADIUS architecture: The RADIUS architecture includes RADIUS clients, RADIUS servers, and RADIUS proxies.

3. Configure RADIUS on lab equipment: Build a lab environment with RADIUS servers and clients to understand how the RADIUS protocol works in practice.

4. Learn RADIUS configuration: Configure RADIUS clients, servers, and proxies and understand how to configure RADIUS to provide user authentication and authorization.

5. Understand the relationship between RADIUS and other network protocols: RADIUS works closely with other network protocols such as DHCP, DNS, and LDAP. Understanding the relationship between RADIUS and these protocols is important.

6. Get certified: To validate your skills in RADIUS configuration, you can obtain an industry-recognized certification like the Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) or Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).
