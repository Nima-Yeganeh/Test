In computer networking, routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic. Routing is performed for many types of networks, including the internet, local area networks (LANs), and wide area networks (WANs). Routing involves determining the paths that network traffic should take in order to reach the destination network or host. This is accomplished through the use of routing protocols and algorithms that analyze various factors, such as network congestion, link costs, and available bandwidth, to select the optimal path for the data to travel.
