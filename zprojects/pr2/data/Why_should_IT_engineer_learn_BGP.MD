As a chatbot, I can tell you that IT engineers should learn BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) because it is the primary routing protocol used to connect different networks on the internet. It is used by service providers and large enterprises to exchange routing information across the internet backbone, and it plays a critical role in ensuring that data packets are efficiently routed from one network to another. By learning BGP, IT engineers can gain knowledge and skills to design, implement, and troubleshoot complex network architectures that require interconnections with other autonomous systems. Additionally, IT engineers who have expertise in BGP are in high demand and can command higher salaries.
