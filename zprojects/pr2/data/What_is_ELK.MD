ELK is a technology stack that is often used for log management and analytics. ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that handles data ingestion and transformation, and Kibana is a web-based visualization platform that lets you interact with Elasticsearch data and create dashboards and reports. Together, these three tools are commonly used for analyzing log data and gaining insights into the behavior of complex systems.
