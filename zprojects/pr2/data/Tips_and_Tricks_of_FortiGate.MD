1. Create a strong policy structure: Creating a strong policy structure within FortiGate is very important. This will allow you to control access to your network and the internet, and protect your sensitive data.

2. Utilize the built-in security tools: FortiGate has many built-in security tools, including antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and application control. Make sure to turn these on and configure them properly to add an extra layer of security to your network.

3. Take advantage of SSL inspection: SSL inspection allows you to inspect encrypted traffic, which can help you detect and prevent advanced threats.

4. Monitor network traffic: Monitoring network traffic is essential for detecting security threats and performance issues. You can use FortiGate's logging and reporting tools to monitor network traffic and identify any anomalies.

5. Use FortiManager for centralized management: If you have a large network with multiple FortiGate devices, consider using FortiManager for centralized management. This will allow you to manage your network more efficiently and reduce the risk of misconfigurations.
