Redis is a popular open-source NoSQL database that is widely used in modern applications. Some key terms related to Redis are:

1. Key-Value Store: Redis is a key-value store in which each data item is stored as a key-value pair.

2. In-memory database: Redis stores all of its data in memory, which allows for very fast read and write operations.

3. Data Structures: Redis supports various data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.

4. Persistence: Redis allows data to be persisted to disk, either asynchronously or synchronously.

5. Pub/Sub: Redis supports publish/subscribe messaging, allowing for real-time communication between clients.

6. Lua scripting: Redis has built-in support for Lua scripting, enabling developers to write custom scripts to perform complex operations on the server.

7. Clustering: Redis can be configured in a cluster to provide high availability and scalability.

8. Transactions: Redis supports atomic transactions, ensuring that multiple operations are performed in an all-or-nothing fashion.

9. TTL (Time-To-Live): Redis allows data to be stored with an expiration time, allowing it to automatically expire and be deleted from the database after a set period.
