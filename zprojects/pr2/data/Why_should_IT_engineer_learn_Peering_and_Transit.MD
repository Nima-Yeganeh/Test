IT engineers should learn about peering and transit because it is essential knowledge in the field of networking. Peering is the process of connecting one network to another network for the purpose of exchanging traffic. Transit, on the other hand, is the process of routing traffic through a network to reach its final destination.

Understanding peering and transit is crucial for IT engineers because it can help them to design and implement networks that are efficient, secure, and cost-effective. By knowing how to peer and transit between networks, IT engineers can optimize network traffic flow and reduce latency, which can improve overall network performance.

Furthermore, as the demand for cloud computing, video streaming, and other data-intensive applications continues to grow, the importance of peering and transit will only increase. This makes it even more important for IT engineers to learn about peering and transit so that they can stay up-to-date with the latest networking technologies and best practices.
