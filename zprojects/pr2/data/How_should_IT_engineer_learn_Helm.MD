To learn Helm, an IT engineer should follow these steps:

1. Start by understanding what Helm is and what it’s used for. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, allowing users to easily package, deploy, and manage applications.

2. Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes, as Helm is deeply integrated with it. Learn about containers, pods, services, and deployments.

3. Learn the basics of YAML, as Helm uses YAML files to define the configuration of your Kubernetes resources.

4. Install Helm and its CLI tool, and experiment with creating charts, which are packages that describe a set of related Kubernetes resources.

5. Learn about Helm’s templating feature, which allows you to create reusable templates for your charts.

6. Understand Chart Repositories, which are collections of charts that can be easily distributed to other users.

7. Practice with creating, installing, upgrading and deleting charts, creating custom templates and releasing your own charts to a community chart repositories.

8. Read through the official Helm documentation, take online courses, and join discussions on relevant blogs, forums, and social media groups to stay up to date with the latest news and developments.
