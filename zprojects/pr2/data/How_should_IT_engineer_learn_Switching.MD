As an IT engineer, one of the best ways to learn Switching is to start with the basics of network communication. This will help you understand the underlying principles of Switching. You can then move on to learning about Switching concepts such as VLANs, STP protocols, Port Security, and so on.

Here are some steps you can follow to learn Switching:

1. Understand network communication and the OSI model.

2. Learn about the different types of Switches and their features.

3. Understand VLANs, how they work, and how to configure them.

4. Learn the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and how it prevents network loops.

5. Learn Port Security and how to protect your network from unauthorized access.

6. Practice configuring Switches in a lab environment.

7. Study for and achieve certifications such as Cisco CCNA or CompTIA Network+.

8. Stay up to date with the latest advancements in Switching technology by reading industry publications and attending seminars and conferences.

Remember that learning Switching takes time and practice. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and keep learning from them. With dedication and hard work, you can become a proficient Switching engineer.
