An IT engineer interested in learning logging SIEM can start by understanding the basic concepts and functionality of logging and SIEM technology. They can learn about various types of logs such as system logs, application logs, security logs, and network logs. They should have good knowledge of different log formats like syslog, JSON, and CSV.

The next step would be to learn SIEM technology and how it can help IT engineers to identify security threats and issues by analyzing log data. They should also understand the various components of a SIEM system like data collection, normalization, and correlation.

IT engineers can gain practical experience using logging and SIEM technology by practicing with open source SIEM solutions like ELK stack and security onion. These platforms can provide IT engineers with a clear understanding of log data analysis and how to detect security issues before they cause damage.

Finally, IT engineers should stay updated with the latest trends and developments in logging and SIEM technology by attending conferences, webinars, and training sessions to keep their skills up-to-date.
