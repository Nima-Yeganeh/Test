DMVPN stands for Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network. It is a type of VPN that allows multiple remote locations to communicate with each other over the Internet without the need for dedicated private links between each location. DMVPN uses a hub-and-spoke topology, where the hub router serves as a central point to which all the remote routers connect. The tunnels are dynamically created between the remote routers, which allows for more efficient use of bandwidth and simplifies the configuration and management of the VPN.
