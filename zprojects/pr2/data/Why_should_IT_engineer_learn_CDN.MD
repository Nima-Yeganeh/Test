IT engineers should learn CDN (Content Delivery Network) because CDNs have become an essential component of modern internet infrastructure. They have several benefits, including improving website performance, providing scalable content delivery, enhancing website security, and reducing bandwidth costs.

CDNs work by distributing content to servers globally, reducing latency and reducing the number of requests that the origin server has to process. As a result, users can access websites and content more quickly and reliably, regardless of their geographic location.

With more and more businesses offering digital services and relying on the internet for their operations, understanding how CDNs work and how to integrate them into a network infrastructure is becoming increasingly important for IT engineers.
