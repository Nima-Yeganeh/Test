Here are some tips and tricks for using MySQL:

1) Use indexes: Indexes help speed up queries by allowing MySQL to quickly find relevant rows in a database table.

2) Optimize table structure: Properly structuring your database tables can improve performance. Use appropriate data types, avoid NULL values where possible, and consider normalizing your data.

3) Use MySQL Workbench: MySQL Workbench is a powerful tool that can help you manage databases, design schema, and query data.

4) Use stored procedures: Stored procedures are reusable blocks of SQL code that can be executed on demand. They can help improve performance and simplify code.

5) Avoid using SELECT *: Only select the columns you need. This can improve performance and prevent unnecessary network traffic.

6) Use prepared statements: Prepared statements help prevent SQL injection attacks and can improve performance by reusing query plans.

7) Analyze and optimize queries: Use MySQLâ€™s EXPLAIN command to analyze the performance of your queries and optimize them accordingly.

8) Use caching: MySQL has built-in caching mechanisms that can help speed up queries for frequently accessed data.

9) Consider partitioning: Partitioning involves splitting large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can improve performance, especially for large datasets.

10) Regularly backup your data: Always backup your data to prevent data loss in case of system failures or other disasters.
