IT engineers should learn file storage because it is a fundamental skill in managing data and information in a computer network. File storage is essential in preserving and managing data files, which are created, accessed, and manipulated by different users across the network. IT engineers must be able to design and implement effective file storage solutions that ensure data availability, security, and integrity. Additionally, mastering file storage skills can help IT engineers optimize network performance, reduce storage costs, and increase operational efficiency. Ultimately, learning file storage is critical to building a solid foundation in computer networking and IT infrastructure management.
