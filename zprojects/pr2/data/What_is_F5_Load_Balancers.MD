F5 Load Balancers are intelligent appliances that distribute traffic across multiple servers in order to optimize application performance, increase reliability and availability, and improve security. They use algorithms and techniques such as round-robin, least connections, and SSL offloading to intelligently direct traffic and ensure that network resources are being used efficiently. F5 Load Balancers are commonly used in enterprise network environments, cloud computing, and data centers.
