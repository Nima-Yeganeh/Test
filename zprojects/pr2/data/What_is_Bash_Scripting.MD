Bash scripting is writing a series of commands in the Bash shell (a command-line interface for Unix-based systems) to automate tasks, streamline processes, and make complex procedures simpler. Bash scripts can be used to run a single command or a group of commands and can access functions or variables to store and retrieve information. Bash scripting is very useful for system administrators, developers, and anyone who wants to automate repetitive tasks in a Unix-based environment.
