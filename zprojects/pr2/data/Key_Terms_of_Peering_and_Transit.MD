Peering and transit are two important terms in the world of Internet networking and routing. Here are their key definitions:

Peering: A process by which two or more Internet service providers (ISPs) connect their networks together to exchange traffic directly, without having to pay for access to internet backbone providers. Peering can be done through physical connections or through virtual peering points (Internet Exchange Points).

Transit: A service provided by an ISP or a backbone provider that allows traffic from one network to access the rest of the Internet. ISPs that purchase transit services pay for the use of the backbone provider's network to transmit traffic to destinations outside of their own network. In other words, transit is a paid service that provides access to the Internet's backbone networks.

In summary, peering is a way for ISPs to voluntarily exchange traffic with one another without incurring additional fees, while transit is a paid service that provides access to the rest of the Internet beyond an ISP's own network.
