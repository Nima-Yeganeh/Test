CDN stands for content delivery network. It is a distributed network of servers that cache and deliver static and dynamic content to users based on their geographic location. It is designed to improve the speed and reliability of delivery of web content such as images, videos, and web pages by reducing the distance between the server delivering the content and the user requesting it. This results in faster page loading times, improved performance, and better user experience.
