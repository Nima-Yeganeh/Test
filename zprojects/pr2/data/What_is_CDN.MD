CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a distributed network of servers located in different geographic locations around the world that work together to deliver web content to end users with high performance and availability. When a user requests content, the CDN server closest to the user's location is used to deliver the content, resulting in faster load times and better user experience. CDNs are commonly used for serving static and dynamic content such as images, videos, HTML files, and JavaScript files.
