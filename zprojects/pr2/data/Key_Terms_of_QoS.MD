QoS stands for "Quality of Service," which refers to a set of technologies and techniques that are used to ensure that network data behaves in a predictable and reliable manner. Some key terms related to QoS include:

1. Traffic shaping: A technique used to manage the flow of network traffic by placing limits on bandwidth usage.

2. Prioritization: A process by which some types of network traffic are given a higher priority than others, allowing them to be processed more quickly and with lower latency.

3. Bandwidth reservation: A mechanism that allows applications or devices to reserve a portion of available network bandwidth for their exclusive use.

4. Packet marking: A technique used to identify and differentiate packets of data based on their sender, destination, or content.

5. Queuing: A mechanism used to manage the order in which packets are transmitted over the network, allowing higher-priority packets to be sent first.
