1. Fiber-optic cable: A cable made up of one or more fiber-optic strands that transmit data using light.

2. Optical transmitter: A device that converts electrical signals into optical signals.

3. Optical receiver: A device that converts optical signals into electrical signals.

4. Fiber-optic coupler: A device that splits or combines light signals between two or more fiber-optic lines.

5. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM): A technology that allows multiple signals of different wavelengths to be transmitted over a single fiber-optic cable.

6. Optical amplifier: A device that boosts the strength of optical signals along a fiber-optic line.

7. Optical attenuator: A device that reduces the strength of optical signals along a fiber-optic line.

8. Single-Mode Fiber: A type of fiber-optic cable that allows only one mode of light to propagate through the fiber.

9. Multimode Fiber: A type of fiber-optic cable that allows multiple modes of light to propagate through the fiber.

10. Optical Network Terminal (ONT): A device that connects fiber-optic cables to customer premises equipment.
