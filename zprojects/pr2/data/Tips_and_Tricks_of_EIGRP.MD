EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol used for medium to large-sized internetworks. Here are some tips and tricks for EIGRP:

1. Use summarization: EIGRP allows summarization of routes at the border routers, which can help reduce routing table size and improve network performance.

2. Use route filtering: EIGRP supports route filtering, which can be used to control which routes are advertised and received across the network.

3. Avoid disjointed subnets: EIGRP is designed to work with contiguous subnets. Avoid subnetting a network in a way that causes subnets to be disjointed from the rest of the network.

4. Use authentication: EIGRP supports authentication to prevent unauthorized access to routing information. Always enable authentication and use strong passwords.

5. Use the feasible successor feature: EIGRP allows for backup routes called feasible successors, which can be used as backup routes in case the primary route fails. Always enable feasible successors for better network availability.

6. Use metric tuning: EIGRP uses a number of factors to determine the best route. The default EIGRP metric includes bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load. Adjust these metrics to improve network performance.

7. Use the EIGRP stub feature: The EIGRP stub feature can help reduce unnecessary routing traffic and improve network performance by limiting the number of routes advertised from one router to another.

By implementing these tips and tricks, you can optimize your EIGRP network for better performance and availability.
