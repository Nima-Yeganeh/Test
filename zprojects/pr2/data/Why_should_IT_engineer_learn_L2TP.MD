IT engineers may want to learn L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) as it is a commonly used protocol for creating Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) over the internet. VPNs are used to securely connect remote users or branch offices to a company's private network, allowing them to access resources as if they were on the local network. 

L2TP is a popular protocol choice for VPNs as it offers a high level of security and can work with a variety of encryption algorithms. IT engineers who know how to configure and troubleshoot L2TP connections can help their organization set up secure remote access and improve overall network security. It also demonstrates a high level of knowledge and expertise in the field of networking.
