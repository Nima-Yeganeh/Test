One advantage of using the Group ID (GID) to identify a group when installing or deleting groups of packages is that it can save time and effort. Instead of manually selecting and installing each individual package, you can simply select the group that contains all the packages you want to install or delete. This can be particularly useful when working with large sets of software, as it eliminates the need to manually track and manage dependencies between packages. It can also ensure that all the necessary software is installed or deleted at once, helping to prevent potential conflicts or inefficiencies in your system.
