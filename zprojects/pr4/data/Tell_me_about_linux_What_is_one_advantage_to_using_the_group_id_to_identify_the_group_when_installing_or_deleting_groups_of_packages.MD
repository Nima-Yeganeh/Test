One advantage of using the group ID to identify the group when installing or deleting groups of packages in Linux is that it allows for easier management of multiple packages that belong to the same group. For example, if you want to install a set of packages related to a specific application or feature, you can simply specify the group ID associated with that set of packages, rather than individually specifying each package to be installed. Similarly, when you need to remove a set of packages, you can simply specify the group ID of the packages you want to remove, rather than removing each package individually. This makes it easier and more efficient to manage large sets of packages and maintain your system.
