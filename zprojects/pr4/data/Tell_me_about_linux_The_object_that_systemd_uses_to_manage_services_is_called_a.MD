The object that systemd uses to manage services is called a `unit`. Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts and provides a common interface for controlling services and processes. Systemd uses units to manage resources such as services, devices, sockets, and timers. Each unit is defined by a unit file which contains all the information necessary to start, stop, and manage the unit.
