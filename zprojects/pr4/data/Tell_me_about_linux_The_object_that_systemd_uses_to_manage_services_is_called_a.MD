The object that systemd uses to manage services is called a `unit`. In systemd, different types of services are represented by different types of units, such as service units, socket units, and timer units. These units define how a service should be started, stopped, monitored, and restarted, and can be managed using various systemd commands and utilities. Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix operating system. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is widely used in server environments, as well as on desktop and mobile devices.
