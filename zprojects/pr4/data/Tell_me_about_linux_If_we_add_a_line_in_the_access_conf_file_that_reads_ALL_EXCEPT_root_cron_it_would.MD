If we add a line in the access.conf file that reads -:ALL EXCEPT root:cron, it would deny all users except root and cron from accessing the system. The access.conf file is a configuration file used in Linux for the Access Control List (ACL) system. It allows system administrators to control user access to various system resources, such as files, directories, and devices. By adding a line to this file as described above, a system administrator can restrict access to the system for all users except the root user and users running cron jobs.
