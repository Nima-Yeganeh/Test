Users can create cronjobs by using the `crontab` command in Linux. `crontab` stands for "cron table" and is used to manage the list of commands that are scheduled to run automatically at specified intervals using the cron daemon. The `crontab` command allows users to create, edit, and remove cron jobs as needed. Users can also specify the schedule for each job and the commands that will be executed. The `crontab` command is widely used in Linux for scheduling regular system maintenance tasks, backups, and other administrative tasks.
