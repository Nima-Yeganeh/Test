To find which package provides the vim command on Linux, you can use the `rpm` command on distributions that use the RPM package manager (e.g. Fedora, CentOS):

```
rpm -qf $(which vim)
```

On distributions that use the DEB package manager (e.g. Ubuntu), you can use the `dpkg-query` command:

```
dpkg-query -S $(which vim)
```

Both commands will return the package name that provides the `vim` command.
