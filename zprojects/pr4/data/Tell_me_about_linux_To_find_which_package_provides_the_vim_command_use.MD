To find which package provides the vim command on Linux, you can use the `which` command in the terminal. 

To use `which`, simply type `which vim` in the terminal and press Enter. This will show you the path to the Vim executable if it is installed on your system. 

If Vim is not installed and you need to install it, then you can use the package manager of your Linux distribution to search for and install the package that provides Vim. For example, on Ubuntu and Debian-based systems, you can use the command `sudo apt-get install vim` to install the Vim editor.
