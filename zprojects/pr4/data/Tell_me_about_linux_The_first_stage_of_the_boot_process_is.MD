That's correct! The first stage of the Linux boot process is called the BIOS stage. During this stage, the computer's BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) checks the hardware components and ensures that they are functioning properly. It then searches for a bootable device, such as a hard drive or USB drive, and loads the first sector of the boot loader program into memory.
