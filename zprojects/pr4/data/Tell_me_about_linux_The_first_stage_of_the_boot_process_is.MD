Linux is a popular open-source operating system that is free to use and highly customizable. It was created in 1991 by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, and today is used by millions of individuals and organizations around the world. 

To answer your question, the first stage of the Linux boot process is known as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) stage. During this stage, the system checks for and initializes essential hardware components like the CPU, RAM, and hard drive. The BIOS then searches for a boot loader, such as GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), which is responsible for loading the Linux kernel into memory and starting the operating system.
