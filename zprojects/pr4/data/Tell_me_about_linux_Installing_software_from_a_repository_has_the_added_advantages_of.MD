Installing software from a repository in Linux has the added advantages of easy management and updates. With a package manager, you can easily search for and install software from a central repository, rather than searching the internet for software and manually downloading and installing it. This allows for more streamlined and secure installation of software, as package managers also handle dependencies and ensure that software is compatible with your system. Additionally, when updates are released for software, package managers can easily update them with a single command, keeping your system up to date and secure.
