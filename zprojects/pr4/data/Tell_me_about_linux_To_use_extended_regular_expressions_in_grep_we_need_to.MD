To use extended regular expressions in `grep`, we need to use the `-E` option. This allows us to use advanced regular expression syntax such as alternation, back references, and lookarounds. For example, the command `grep -E 'pattern' file.txt` would search for the regular expression `pattern` in the text file `file.txt`.
