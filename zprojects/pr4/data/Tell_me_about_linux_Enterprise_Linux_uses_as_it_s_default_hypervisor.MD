Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) uses KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) as its default hypervisor. KVM is included in the Linux kernel, providing virtualization capabilities that allow multiple virtual machines to run on the same physical machine. It is an open-source solution that offers high performance and scalability, making it a popular choice for hosting virtualized applications and services.
