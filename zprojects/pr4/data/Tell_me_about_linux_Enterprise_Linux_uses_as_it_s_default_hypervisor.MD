Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) as its default hypervisor. KVM is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware that allows multiple guest operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical host. It is a mature and stable technology that provides excellent performance and scalability. In addition to KVM, Red Hat Enterprise Linux also supports other virtualization technologies such as Xen and VMware.
