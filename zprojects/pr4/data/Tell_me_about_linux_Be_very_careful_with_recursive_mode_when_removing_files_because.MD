Be very careful with recursive mode when removing files in Linux because it will delete all the files and directories within the specified directory, without asking for confirmation. This can cause permanent loss of data if used incorrectly. It is always recommended to double-check which directory you are in and review the command before executing it with the '-r' or '-rf' options.
