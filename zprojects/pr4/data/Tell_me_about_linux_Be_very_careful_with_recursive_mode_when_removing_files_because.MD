Be very careful with recursive mode when removing files because it can delete not only the intended files but also the entire directory tree and all of its contents. This can lead to unintended data loss and potentially damaging consequences. It's always recommended to double-check what you are deleting and ensure you have proper backups before using the recursive mode for file removal in Linux.
