The Enterprise Linux installer typically asks to choose a language twice as a way to ensure that the user's language preference is recorded accurately and without errors. 

During the first prompt, the installer asks for the language preference for the installer itself, which is used to display the interface and any messages or prompts that appear during the installation process. 

During the second prompt, the installer asks for the language preference for the final installed operating system. This ensures that the language preference is applied to the entire system, including the installed operating system, applications, and user interface. 

By asking for the language preference twice, the installer helps to prevent any errors or misunderstandings that could occur if the language was only asked for once.
