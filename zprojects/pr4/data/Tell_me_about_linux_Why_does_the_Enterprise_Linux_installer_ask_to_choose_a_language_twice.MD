The Enterprise Linux installer typically asks to choose a language twice for two different purposes. 

The first time you are asked to choose a language is during the initial installation process. This is to set the language preference for the installer itself. The installer needs to display its user interface in a language that the user understands.

The second time you are asked to choose a language is during the actual installation of the operating system. This is to set the default language for the system itself. Once the installation is complete, the system will use this language as the default language for all users and applications, unless otherwise specified.

By asking for the language preference twice, the installer ensures that both the user interface and the operating system language are set correctly, providing a better user experience for the user.
