The Enterprise Linux installer asks you to choose a language twice for two different reasons. The first time, you are asked to choose a language for the installer itself. This sets the language for the graphical user interface of the installer, which will be used to guide you through the installation process.

The second time you are asked to choose a language is during the installation process itself. This sets the default language for your new operating system. This choice will determine which language is used for system messages, menus, and other text-based elements in the operating system.

By asking you to choose the language twice, the installer ensures that the installer interface and the operating system are both configured correctly. This helps to avoid confusion and ensure that your new system works as expected right from the start.
