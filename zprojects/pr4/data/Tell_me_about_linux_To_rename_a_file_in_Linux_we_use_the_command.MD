To rename a file in Linux, we use the "mv" command. This command stands for "move", but it can be used to both move and rename files. By specifying the original file name and the desired new file name, you can rename a file in Linux. For example, to rename a file named "old_name.txt" to "new_name.txt", you would use the following command: 

`mv old_name.txt new_name.txt`

This will rename the file and it will no longer be accessible by its old name.
