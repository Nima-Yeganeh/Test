To rename a file in Linux, we use the `mv` (short for "move") command. This command can be used to rename an existing file or move it to a different directory. The syntax for renaming a file using `mv` is as follows:

```
mv old_filename new_filename
```

For example, if we want to rename a file named `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`, we can use the following command:

```
mv file1.txt file2.txt
```

This command will rename `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`. If a file with the name `file2.txt` already exists, it will be overwritten.
