When `systemctl` makes a service start automatically at boot in Linux, it's referred to as "enabling" the service. This can be done using the command `systemctl enable <servicename>`, which will create a symlink to the service unit file in the appropriate directory, usually the `/etc/systemd/system` directory. This symlink will be read and executed by `systemd` during system boot, ensuring that the service is started automatically.
