When `systemctl` makes a service start automatically at boot, it is referred to as "enabling" the service. This means that the service will be started automatically during the boot up process of the Linux system, ensuring that it is always running in the background. Enabling a service on boot can be useful for network services, such as web servers or database servers, that need to be running continuously in order to serve requests from other applications or users.
