In Linux, network interfaces are commonly named using predictable device names instead of traditional interface names, such as eth0 or wlan0. The device name enp0s25 indicates that it is an Ethernet interface that is integrated into the motherboard, and it is assigned the name based on its location on the PCI bus. This naming convention is known as "systemd predictable network interface names" and is used to ensure consistency across different systems and distributions.
