In Linux, a network interface named enp0s25 is a physical Ethernet device. The naming convention for network interfaces in Linux has changed from the traditional eth0, eth1 to a new scheme based on the location of the network interface in the system. The new naming scheme uses predictable names such as enp0s25, where "en" stands for Ethernet, "p0" stands for PCI bus number 0, and "s25" stands for slot number 25. This helps in identifying and managing network interfaces on the system more easily, especially in large-scale deployments.
