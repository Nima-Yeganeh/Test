The `dnf` command, which stands for Dandified YUM, is a package manager used in some Linux distributions such as Fedora and CentOS. It is similar to the `yum` package manager found in other distributions such as CentOS and RHEL, but with some key differences.

One way `dnf` handles removing kernels differently than `yum` is with its use of the `dnf remove` command. This command is used to remove software packages, including kernels in Linux systems. When you run the `dnf remove` command to remove a kernel, `dnf` will automatically remove all related packages and dependencies.

In contrast, when you use the `yum remove` command to remove a kernel, `yum` removes only the specified packages related to that kernel but doesn't remove any dependencies and related packages that are no longer in use. This could potentially lead to a situation known as dependency hell which can make it very hard to manage your system.

In summary, while both `yum` and `dnf` can be used to manage software packages, `dnf` is a more advanced package manager that handles dependency management and removal of related packages in a more efficient way, making it more powerful and convenient.
