To see VM boot screen output on a graphical console after doing an unattended install, we need to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions package on the guest operating system. This package provides drivers and other software components that enable advanced features such as clipboard sharing, drag and drop between host and guest, and enhanced graphics support. Once installed, the guest operating system should be able to display the boot screen output on a graphical console.
