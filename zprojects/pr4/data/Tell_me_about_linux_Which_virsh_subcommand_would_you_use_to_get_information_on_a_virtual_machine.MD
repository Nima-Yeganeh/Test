The `virsh dominfo` subcommand can be used to get information about a virtual machine in Linux. This subcommand displays information about the domain including its name, UUID, title, memory usage, CPU time used, and more. You can use this command to check the status of a virtual machine, troubleshoot problems, or modify the configuration of the virtual machine. The `virsh` command-line tool is commonly used to manage virtual machines on Linux servers running KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) hypervisors.
