Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix. One main difference between using a file compressor separately and using the compressor as an option to tar in Linux is that when using a file compressor separately, you would need to compress each file individually, which can be time-consuming. On the other hand, when using the compressor as an option to tar, it allows you to compress multiple files or directories into a single compressed archive file. This can save time and make it easier to transfer or store the compressed files. Additionally, using tar allows for additional options such as including or excluding specific files or directories, preserving file permissions and ownership, and creating and extracting compressed archives in different formats.
