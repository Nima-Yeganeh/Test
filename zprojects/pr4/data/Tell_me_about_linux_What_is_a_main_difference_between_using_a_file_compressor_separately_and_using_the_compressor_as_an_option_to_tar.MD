Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It is widely used in web servers, supercomputers, mobile devices, and desktop computers.

When you compress a file or directory using a file compressor like gzip or bzip2, the compressed file is created separately and saved as a new file with a different file extension. This means that you need to compress the file first and then archive it using a tool like tar.

On the other hand, when you use a compressor as an option to tar, it compresses the files and directories as it archives them. This means that you don't need to compress the files first and then archive them, as tar handles both operations simultaneously. This can save you time and disk space.

Another advantage of using tar with a compressor option is that you can easily extract the files and directories from the compressed archive using a single command, since tar automatically detects and handles the compression format used in the archive.
