Linux is an open-source operating system that is often used as an alternative to Windows and macOS. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

The main difference between using a file compressor separately and using the compressor as an option to tar is that when you use a compressor separately, you have to compress each file individually. This means that you have to compress each file one at a time, which can be time-consuming and tedious. However, when you use the compressor as an option to tar, you can compress multiple files into a single compressed file. This is much more efficient and can save you a lot of time and effort. 

To use tar with a file compressor, you simply use a command like this: tar -zcvf compressed_file_name.tar.gz file1 file2 file3. Here, the -zcvf options tell tar to compress (using gzip), create the archive, and provide verbose output during the process. You can use other compressors like bzip2 or xz and modify the options accordingly.
