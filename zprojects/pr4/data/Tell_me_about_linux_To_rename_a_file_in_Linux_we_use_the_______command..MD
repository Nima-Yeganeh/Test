To rename a file in Linux, we use the `mv` command. The `mv` command stands for "move" or "rename" and is used to move a file from one location to another and also to rename files. For example, to rename a file named "oldname.txt" to "newname.txt", you can use the following command:

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

This will rename the file "oldname.txt" to "newname.txt". If you want to move the file to a new location while renaming it, you can specify the destination path as well:

```bash
mv oldname.txt /path/to/newname.txt
```

This will move the file "oldname.txt" to the "/path/to/" directory and rename it to "newname.txt".
