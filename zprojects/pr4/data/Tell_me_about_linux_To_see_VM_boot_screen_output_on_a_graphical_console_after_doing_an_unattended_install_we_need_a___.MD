To see VM boot screen output on a graphical console after doing an unattended install on Linux, we need a virtual console or a remote desktop viewer. This allows the user to see the graphical interface of the Linux operating system. Virtual consoles are accessed using a combination of keys on the keyboard, while remote desktop viewers allow the user to view the console over a network connection. Both options can be helpful for troubleshooting and in debugging the boot process of the operating system.
