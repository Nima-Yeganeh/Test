Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on the Unix operating system. It is widely used in servers, supercomputers, and mobile devices. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

The stage of the boot process where system services are started is called the init process. This is the first process started by the Linux kernel and is responsible for bringing up other system processes and services. The init process is typically replaced by a more advanced initialization system such as systemd or Upstart in most modern Linux distributions.
