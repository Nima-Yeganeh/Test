In Linux, a system service is called a daemon. A daemon is a background process that runs continuously, performing certain tasks or providing certain services. Examples of daemons in Linux include the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd), the Apache web server daemon (httpd), and the Secure Shell daemon (sshd). Daemons typically run with root privileges, and can be started, stopped, or restarted using command-line tools like systemctl or service.
