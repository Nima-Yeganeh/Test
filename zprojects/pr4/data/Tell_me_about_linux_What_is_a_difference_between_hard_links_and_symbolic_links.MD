Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It is a popular choice for servers, as well as for personal computers, because of its stability, security, and versatility.

There are two types of links in Linux: hard links and symbolic links.

A hard link is a file that has the same inode number as another file on the same file system. When you create a hard link, you are essentially creating a duplicate of the original file, but the contents of the file are still stored in the same location on the file system. Hard links can be used to create multiple names for the same file, and changes to one file will affect all of the other linked files.

A symbolic link, on the other hand, is a file that points to another file or directory using a symbolic path, rather than a physical path. When you create a symbolic link, you are creating a new file that acts as a shortcut to another file or directory. Symbolic links can be used to create shortcuts to frequently used files or directories, or to provide access to files or directories that are stored in other parts of the file system. 

In summary, the main difference between hard links and symbolic links is that hard links create multiple references to the same file, while symbolic links create a new file that points to another file or directory.
