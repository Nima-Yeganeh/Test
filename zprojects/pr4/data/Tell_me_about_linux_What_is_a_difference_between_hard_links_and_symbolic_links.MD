Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and it can run on various hardware architectures.

In Linux, hard links and symbolic links are two types of links used to link files to other files or directories.

A hard link is a direct link to the inode of a file. This means that when you create a hard link to a file, you are creating another name for the same file, and any changes made to either file will affect both files. Hard links can only be created for files within the same file system.

On the other hand, a symbolic link (also known as a soft link) is a special type of file that points to another file or directory by its path name. It works like a shortcut in Windows, and any changes made to the original file will not affect the symbolic link. Symbolic links can be created across different file systems and even across networks.

In summary, hard links are direct links to the inode of a file and create another name for the same file, while symbolic links are special files that point to another file or directory by its path name.
