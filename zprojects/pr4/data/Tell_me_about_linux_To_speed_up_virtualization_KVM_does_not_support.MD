To speed up virtualization, it is important to optimize the performance of the Linux host operating system. Linux is a popular choice for hosting virtual machines due its efficiency and flexibility.

KVM, or Kernel-based Virtual Machine, is a type-1 hypervisor built into the Linux kernel, which allows virtual machines to run directly on the host operating system, without the need for an additional layer of software.

However, KVM only supports hardware-assisted virtualization, which requires a CPU with virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT or AMD-V. If your CPU does not have these extensions, KVM will not work properly.

Therefore, to speed up virtualization, it is important to ensure that your hardware supports virtualization extensions, and that the host operating system is properly configured to take advantage of these features. Additionally, optimizing the performance of the virtual machines themselves can also improve overall virtualization performance.
