Linux RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) can provide detailed information about packages installed on a Linux system. RPM is a command-line package management system used by many Linux distributions, including Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, and Oracle Linux. By using the RPM command with various options, you can find out details about the name, version, release, dependencies, installed files, and other metadata associated with a specific RPM package. Additionally, RPM can also verify the integrity of individual packages and their contents to ensure that they have not been tampered or corrupted. This helps system administrators keep their systems secure and up-to-date with the latest software packages.
