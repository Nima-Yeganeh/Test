To ensure Enterprise Linux guest VMs can shut down completely, you need to install the latest version of the integration services for the virtualization technology you are using, such as Hyper-V, VMWare, or VirtualBox. Integration services provide drivers and services that allow the virtual machine to communicate with the virtualization host and perform operations like shut down, restart, and time synchronization. Without integration services, the virtual machine may not be able to shut down cleanly or may experience other performance issues.
