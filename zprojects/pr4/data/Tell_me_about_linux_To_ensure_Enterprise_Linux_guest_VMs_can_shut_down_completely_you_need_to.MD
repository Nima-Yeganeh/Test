To ensure Enterprise Linux guest VMs can shut down completely, you need to install the Linux Integration Services (LIS) package. This package includes drivers and services that integrate with Hyper-V and provide enhanced performance, reliability, and support for virtualization scenarios. The LIS package enables features such as time synchronization, backup support, and automatic virtual machine shutdown. Without the LIS package, the guest VM may not be able to shut down completely or may experience compatibility issues with Hyper-V.
