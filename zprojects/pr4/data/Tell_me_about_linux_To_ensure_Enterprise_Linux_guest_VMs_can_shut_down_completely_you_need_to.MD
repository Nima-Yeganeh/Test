To ensure proper shutdown of Enterprise Linux guest VMs, you need to enable the "acpid" service. This service allows the guest VMs to receive an ACPI power button signal from the hypervisor, which initiates the shutdown process. Without this service enabled, the guest VMs may not shut down completely and can result in potential data loss or other system issues.
