In Linux, the `tar` command is used to archive and compress files and directories. The `--xattrs` option in tar is used to include extended attributes (xattrs) in the archive file.

Extended attributes are additional data associated with a filesystem object, like a file. This can include information about the object's author, encoding, time of last access, etc. If you provide `--xattrs` option while creating the archive, it will include this extended attribute information in the archive file.

This can be useful when you want to preserve the metadata information associated with the files and directories while transferring them to another system. For example, if you want to transfer a directory with extended attributes from one system to another, you can create an archive of that directory using `tar` with the `--xattrs` option and then transfer the archive file to the destination.
