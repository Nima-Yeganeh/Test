When the `--xattrs` option is provided to `tar`, it will include any extended attributes or metadata associated with the files being archived. Extended attributes can contain additional information about a file, such as access control information or security labels.

By including extended attributes in the archive, you can preserve this additional information when restoring the archive on another system. However, it's important to note that not all filesystems support extended attributes, so this option may not be relevant for all use cases.

Overall, the `--xattrs` option allows for a more comprehensive backup or transfer of files while preserving important metadata that might be lost otherwise.
