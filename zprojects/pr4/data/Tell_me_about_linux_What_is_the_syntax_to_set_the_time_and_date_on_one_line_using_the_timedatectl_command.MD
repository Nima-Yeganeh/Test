In Linux, you can use the timedatectl command to set the time and date. The syntax to set the time and date on one line using the timedatectl command is:

```
timedatectl set-time "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
```

Replace the "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" with the current date and time in the format "year-month-day hour:minute:second". For example:

```
timedatectl set-time "2022-11-22 10:30:00"
```

This command will set the date to November 22, 2022, and the time to 10:30:00.
