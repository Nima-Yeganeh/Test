Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used in servers, desktops, and other computing devices. Its popularity comes from its flexibility, security, and stability.

If the update command fails because of broken package dependencies, the correct course of action would be to resolve the dependencies first. This can be done by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -f
```

This command will attempt to install any missing dependencies and fix any broken dependencies. Once this is done, you can then attempt to update the OS again.

Alternatively, if the dependency issue is more complex, you may need to manually remove and reinstall the affected packages or use a package management tool like Synaptic or Aptitude to resolve the issue. It's important to carefully read any error messages or warnings that come up during the update process to properly diagnose and address any issues.
