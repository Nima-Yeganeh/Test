Linux Journald differs from traditional logging services because its logs are structured by default, unlike the plain text logs often used by traditional logging services. This means that the logs are organized in a more uniform way and can be easily searched, filtered, and analyzed using tools such as the `journalctl` command. Additionally, Journald logs can include rich metadata, such as the originating process, user, and system information, which can provide more context and help with diagnosing issues.
