Linux journald differs from traditional logging services because its logs are structured by default. This means that the log entries include metadata such as the log source, process ID, and timestamp, in addition to the log message itself. This structured logging allows for more efficient and organized analysis of logs, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and identify patterns.
