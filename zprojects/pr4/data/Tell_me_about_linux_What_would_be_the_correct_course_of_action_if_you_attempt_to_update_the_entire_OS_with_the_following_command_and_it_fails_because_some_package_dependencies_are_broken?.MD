In Linux, updating the entire OS with one command is not recommended as it can cause issues like the one you described where some package dependencies are broken. 

If you attempt to update the entire OS with the command and it fails due to broken package dependencies, the correct course of action would be to run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -f
```

This command attempts to fix broken package dependencies by removing any packages that are no longer needed and installing any missing dependencies. Once this command has finished running, you can attempt to update the entire OS again. 

Alternatively, you could try to update the OS one package at a time using the following command: 

```
sudo apt-get upgrade <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the specific package you want to update. This method can take longer but can help you identify which package is causing the dependency issue.
