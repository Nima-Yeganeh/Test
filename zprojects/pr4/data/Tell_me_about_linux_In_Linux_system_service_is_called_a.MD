In Linux system, a service is called a "daemon." Daemons are programs that run in the background and perform tasks such as handling requests, managing resources, and executing tasks at specific times or when specific events occur. They are essential components of the Linux operating system and play a crucial role in its stability and reliability. Some common examples of daemons in Linux include the Apache web server daemon, the SSH daemon, and the print spooler daemon.
