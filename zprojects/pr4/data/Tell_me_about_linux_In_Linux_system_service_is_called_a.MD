In Linux, a system service is called a daemon (pronounced "day-mon"). Daemons are background processes that run continuously, waiting for specific events or requests to occur. They are often used to perform tasks that need to be done on a regular basis, such as printing documents or checking for updates. Daemons can be started or stopped using commands like systemctl or service, and many Linux distributions come with a variety of daemons pre-installed to provide core system functionality.
