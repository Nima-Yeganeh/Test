To do an unattended installation into a KVM guest, we need to create a Kickstart file. A Kickstart file is a script that is used by the Red Hat operating system installer to automate the installation process. It contains a set of instructions that the installer will follow to automatically configure the installation settings, such as the language, keyboard, and partitioning layout. By using a Kickstart file, we can perform an unattended installation of Linux in a KVM guest without needing to manually enter installation settings every time.
