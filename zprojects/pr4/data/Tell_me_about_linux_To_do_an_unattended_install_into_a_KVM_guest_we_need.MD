To do an unattended install into a KVM guest, we need to first create a configuration file that specifies the installation options, such as which operating system to install and its parameters. This configuration file can be in the form of a Kickstart file for Red Hat-based distributions or a preseed file for Debian-based distributions. 

In addition, we also need to have a virtual hard disk image for the KVM guest, access to the installation media (such as an ISO image), and a method for automating the installation process, such as using the command-line tool virt-install or a graphical user interface like virt-manager. Once these components are in place, we can start the unattended installation process and let the KVM guest install itself automatically, without requiring manual intervention.
