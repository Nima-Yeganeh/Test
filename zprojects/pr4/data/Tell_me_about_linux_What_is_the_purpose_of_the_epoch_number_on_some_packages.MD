The epoch number is used in Linux package management systems, such as RPM and Deb, to indicate a major version change of a package. It can be useful to distinguish between packages with a different package name but the same version number. 

For example, suppose there are two versions of a package, "mypackage-1.2.3" and "newpackage-1.2.3". These packages may have very different contents, but they have the same version number. In this case, the epoch number is used to indicate that the "newpackage" is actually a different package from "mypackage", even though they have the same version number. 

So if "mypackage-1.2.3" has an epoch of 0, and "newpackage-1.2.3" has an epoch of 1, a package manager will know that the two packages are different. The epoch number is usually only used in cases where a significant change has been made to a package, and is not always present on packages.
