In Linux, the epoch number is used to version packages and is sometimes added to the version number as a prefix (for example, "1:2.1.3-4" instead of "2.1.3-4"). The epoch number is used to override the version comparison algorithm in the package manager, in case a package needs to be "downgraded" to an earlier version with a higher epoch number.

For example, if a package with version "1:2.1.3-4" is installed and a newer version "2.2.0-1" is released without an epoch number, the package manager would assume that the newer version is not an upgrade because the version number is lower. However, if the newer version was "1:2.2.0-1", the package manager would recognize it as an upgrade because the epoch number is higher.

The epoch number should only be used as a last resort, as it can cause confusion and make package management more complicated. It is typically only used when a package undergoes major changes in its packaging or dependencies, to ensure that a new version is recognized as an upgrade and installed properly.
