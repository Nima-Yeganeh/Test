In Linux, the epoch number on some packages is used to indicate versioning and release information. It is a way to make sure that the system recognizes the package as a distinct entity, even when there are changes to the version or release numbering.

The epoch number is typically assigned when there is a major change or overhaul of the package that warrants a reset of the version numbering. It is usually set to 0 by default, and incremented when necessary.

For example, if a package is released with version number 1.0, but later there is a significant change that completely revamps the package, the maintainers may choose to assign an epoch number of 1 to indicate that this is a major change. The subsequent releases will then be numbered as 1:1.0.1, 1:1.0.2, etc.

This helps to make sure that the system can differentiate between different versions of the package and properly manage updates and dependencies.
