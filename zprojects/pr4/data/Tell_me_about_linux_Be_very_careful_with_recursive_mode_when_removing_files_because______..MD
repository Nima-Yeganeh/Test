Be very careful with recursive mode when removing files on Linux because it could delete files and directories that you didn't intend to delete, leading to loss of important data or even system failure. Recursive mode instructs the system to perform the action on the specified directory and all its subdirectories, which means that all files within these directories will be affected. If not used carefully, it could cause severe consequences.
