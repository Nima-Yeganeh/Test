When using the macvtap bridge in Linux, the host cannot communicate with the guest VM because macvtap is a type of virtual network device that allows the guest VM to have direct access to the physical network interface card (NIC) of the host machine. This means that the host NIC is no longer available for use by the host, and as a result, it cannot communicate with the guest VM over the network. The macvtap bridge is designed for scenarios where the guest VM needs to be on the same network as the host machine, but without the need for complex network configurations and setups.
