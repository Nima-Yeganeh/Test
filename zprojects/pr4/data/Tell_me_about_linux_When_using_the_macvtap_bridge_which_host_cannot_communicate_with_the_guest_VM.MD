When using the macvtap bridge in Linux, the host cannot communicate with the guest VM if the macvtap interface is configured in "isolated mode." This mode allows the guest VM to communicate with the outside network, but it isolates the guest VM from the host and other VMs on the same host. In this mode, the macvtap interface acts as a dedicated NIC for the guest, with its own unique MAC address, separate from the host's physical NIC. 

To allow communication between the host and guest VM using the macvtap bridge, the macvtap interface should be configured to use either "bridge" or "private" mode. In "bridge" mode, the macvtap interface shares the same MAC address as the underlying physical NIC on the host, while in "private" mode, the macvtap interface has its own unique MAC address, but can still communicate with the host and other VMs on the same physical host.
