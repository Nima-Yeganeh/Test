To enter emergency mode on Linux, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Reboot the system and press the Shift key during the boot process to enter the GRUB menu.
2. Select the Linux entry and press the 'e' key to edit the boot parameters.
3. Find the line that starts with "linux" or "linux16" and add "emergency" or "sysroot=/" to the end of it.
4. Press Ctrl + x or F10 to boot into emergency mode.

In emergency mode, the system will start in a minimal environment with only a few services running. This is useful for troubleshooting and repairing systems that cannot boot in normal mode due to software or hardware issues.
