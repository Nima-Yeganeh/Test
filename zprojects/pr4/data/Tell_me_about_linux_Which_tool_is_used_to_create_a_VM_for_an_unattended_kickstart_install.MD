The tool commonly used to create a VM for an unattended kickstart install on Linux is called "virt-install". This tool allows users to create and manage virtual machines from the command line, and it is typically used to automate the installation of guest operating systems through the use of pre-defined kickstart files. Virt-install is part of the libvirt virtualization toolkit, which is widely used on many Linux distributions such as CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian.
