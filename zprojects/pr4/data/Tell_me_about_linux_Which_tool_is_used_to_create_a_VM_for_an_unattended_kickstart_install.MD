The tool that is commonly used in Linux to create a virtual machine (VM) for an unattended kickstart install is called "virt-install." Virt-install is a command-line tool that creates and manages virtual machines using the libvirt library. It can be used to create various types of virtual machines, including KVM, Xen, QEMU, and more. With virt-install, you can define the VM's hardware resources, disk, network, and more. It can also be used to install the operating system automatically using a kickstart file, which is a file that contains automated installation instructions for the OS. So, using virt-install, you can create a VM and use a kickstart file to automate the entire installation process without any user intervention.
