The tool used to create a VM for an unattended kickstart install on Linux is called virt-install. This tool is a command-line utility that simplifies the creation of virtual machines using KVM-based hypervisors. It allows you to specify the virtual machine's hardware configuration as well as various installation parameters, including the kickstart file, which can automate the installation process. With virt-install, you can create virtual machines on a Linux host without the need for a graphical interface or a dedicated virtual machine manager application.
