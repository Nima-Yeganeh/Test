You can find packages that have been replaced by different packages using the `aptitude` command on Linux. This command is a powerful package manager that allows you to search for installed and available packages, as well as find packages that have been replaced by newer versions. By using `aptitude search '~o'`, you can list all packages that are considered obsolete and have been replaced by other packages in your system.
