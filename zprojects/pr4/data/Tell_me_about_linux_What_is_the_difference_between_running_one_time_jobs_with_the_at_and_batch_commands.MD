In Linux, the `at` and `batch` commands are used to schedule the execution of commands at a specific time or when system resources are available. The main difference between the two commands is the method by which they execute the scheduled tasks.

The `at` command allows you to schedule a one-time job to be executed at a specific time. You specify the time using the `at` command, and the job executes at that time. Once the job has executed, it is removed from the queue.

The `batch` command, on the other hand, is used to schedule jobs that run when system resources are available. These jobs are typically run during times of low system usage, such as at night or over the weekend. Jobs scheduled with the `batch` command are executed one at a time, as system resources become available.

So, the main difference between the `at` and `batch` commands is that `at` is used to run one-time jobs at a specific time while `batch` is used to run jobs when resources are available.
