In Linux, the `at` and `batch` commands are used to schedule one-time jobs, but they differ in the way they handle these jobs. 

The `at` command is used to schedule a job to run at a specific time in the future, while the `batch` command schedules a job to run when the system load average drops below a certain threshold. 

The main difference is that `at` jobs are usually scheduled to run at a precise time, while `batch` jobs are typically scheduled to run when the system is less busy. `at` jobs are queued and executed one by one, while `batch` jobs are executed in batches as soon as the system is idle.

This makes the `at` command suitable for jobs that are time-sensitive, such as running a backup at midnight, while the `batch` command is more suitable for running jobs that can be deferred, such as running software updates during off-hours.
