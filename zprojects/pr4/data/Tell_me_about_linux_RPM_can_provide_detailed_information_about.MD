Linux RPM can provide detailed information about packages that are installed on a Linux system. RPM is the package management system used by many Linux distributions such as Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora. When a package is installed using RPM, it creates a database of the installed packages. Using the "rpm" command with appropriate options, one can retrieve detailed information about a particular package, such as its version, description, files installed, dependencies, and much more. This feature is particularly useful when troubleshooting issues with software or when managing multiple Linux systems.
