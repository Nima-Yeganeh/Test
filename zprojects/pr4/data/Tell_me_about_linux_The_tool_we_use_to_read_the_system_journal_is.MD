Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on the Unix operating system. It is widely used in servers, desktop computers, smartphones, and other devices. The tool used to read the system journal in Linux is called journalctl. It is a command-line utility that allows users to query, retrieve, and view system log data as stored by the systemd-journald service. It can be used to filter by a specific time range, message severity, or process.
