Linux is a free and open-source operating system built around the Linux kernel. It was first developed and released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. Linux is known for its stability, security, and customization options. It is widely used in enterprise systems, web servers, databases, mobile devices, and embedded devices.

The tool that is commonly used to read the system journal in Linux is called "journalctl". It is a powerful utility that shows logs from the systemd journal and helps in troubleshooting system issues. With the journalctl command, you can see log messages from different users, services, and applications, filter them based on their priorities, timestamps, and sources, and format them in various ways.
