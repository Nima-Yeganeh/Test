To show all DNF (Dandified YUM) groups in Linux, you need to enter the following command in the terminal:

```sudo dnf grouplist -v```

This will display a full list of all available groups for installation, including hidden and system groups. The -v option tells DNF to show the entire group hierarchy, which can be helpful for understanding the relationships between different groups.
