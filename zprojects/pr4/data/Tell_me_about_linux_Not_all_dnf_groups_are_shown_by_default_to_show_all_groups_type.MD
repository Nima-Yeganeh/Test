To show all groups in Linux using the DNF package manager, you can use the command `dnf group list --hidden`. This will show all available groups, including the ones that are hidden by default. DNF is a package manager used in certain Linux distributions, such as Fedora and CentOS, to install, remove, and update packages and dependencies. Groups in DNF refer to a collection of packages that are related in some way, such as a set of development tools or a graphical user interface environment.
