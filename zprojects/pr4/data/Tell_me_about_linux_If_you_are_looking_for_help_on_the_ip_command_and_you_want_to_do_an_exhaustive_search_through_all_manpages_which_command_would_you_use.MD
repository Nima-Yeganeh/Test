If you want to do an exhaustive search through all the man pages for a command in Linux, you can use the `apropos` command followed by the keyword you are searching for. 

So to search for the `ip` command, you can enter the following command:
```
apropos ip
```

This will display the list of all man pages which have the keyword `ip` in their description. You can then use the `man` command to view the specific manual page for the command you want to use. 

For example, if you want to view the manual page for the `ip` command, you can enter the following command:
```
man ip
```

This will display the help documentation for the `ip` command and its various options.
