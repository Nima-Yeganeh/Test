The Linux VIM editor has three modes of operation:

1. Command mode: This is the default mode and is used for navigation, searching, and other administrative tasks.

2. Insert mode: In this mode, users can insert and edit text using the keyboard.

3. Visual mode: This mode allows users to select and manipulate blocks of text. 

The VIM editor also has other advanced modes like the Ex mode, which is used for advanced text manipulation and batch editing. Users can switch between these modes using various keyboard commands.
