Yes, that's correct. The Linux text editor VIM has three modes of operation. They are:

1. Normal mode: This is the default mode of operation. Here, you can move around the document, delete, copy, and paste text, perform searches and replace operations, and more.

2. Insert mode: In this mode, you can insert and edit text just like in any other text editor. You'll need to press the "i" key to enter insert mode.

3. Visual mode: This mode is used for selecting and manipulating text. You can highlight text in this mode and perform operations like copying, cutting, and pasting. You'll need to press "v" to enter visual mode.
