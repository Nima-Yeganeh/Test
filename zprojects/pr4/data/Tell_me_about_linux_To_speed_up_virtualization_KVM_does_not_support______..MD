To speed up virtualization, Linux offers KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) as a hypervisor. KVM is a popular choice for running virtual machines on Linux because it provides excellent performance and can support a variety of guest operating systems. However, KVM does not support paravirtualization by default, which can slow down the virtualization process.

Paravirtualization allows the guest operating system to cooperate with the host operating system to improve performance. In KVM, this can be achieved by using the VirtIO drivers. VirtIO is a set of drivers that allow a paravirtualized guest operating system to communicate directly with the host, which can significantly improve performance and reduce overhead.

Therefore, if you want to speed up virtualization with KVM, you will need to enable paravirtualization using VirtIO drivers. This will allow the guest operating system to communicate more efficiently with the host, resulting in faster virtualization performance.
