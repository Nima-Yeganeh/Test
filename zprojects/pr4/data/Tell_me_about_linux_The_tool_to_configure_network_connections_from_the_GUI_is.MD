The tool to configure network connections from the GUI in Linux is usually referred to as the Network Manager. It is a software utility that simplifies the process of managing network connections by providing a graphical user interface for managing network settings, such as wireless, wired, and VPN connections. The Network Manager makes it easy for users to connect to different networks and switch between them quickly and easily, without having to use the command line or edit configuration files manually.
