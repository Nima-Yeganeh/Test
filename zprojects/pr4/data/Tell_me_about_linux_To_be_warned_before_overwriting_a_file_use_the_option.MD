In Linux, to be warned before overwriting a file, you can use the `-i` option. This option prompts the user for confirmation before overwriting any files. For example, if you're trying to copy a file to a destination where a file with the same name already exists, the `-i` option will ask if you want to overwrite the existing file before proceeding. It's a handy precaution that can help prevent accidental data loss.
