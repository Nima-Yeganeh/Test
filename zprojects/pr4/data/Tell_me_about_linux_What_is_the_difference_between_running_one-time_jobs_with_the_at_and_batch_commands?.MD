In Linux, the `at` and `batch` commands are used for scheduling one-time jobs to run at a later time. The main difference between these two commands is the way they handle the scheduling of jobs.

The `at` command is used to schedule a job to run at a specific time in the future. For example, you can use the `at` command to schedule a backup job to run at midnight tonight. The syntax for using the `at` command is as follows:

```
at TIME <<EOF
    COMMAND
EOF
```

The `TIME` parameter specifies when the job should run, and the `COMMAND` parameter specifies the command or script to be executed.

The `batch` command, on the other hand, is used to schedule a job to run when the system load is low. This means that the job will not run immediately, but will be queued until the system is not busy. The syntax for using the `batch` command is similar to that of the `at` command:

```
batch <<EOF
    COMMAND
EOF
```

In summary, the main difference between the `at` and `batch` commands is that `at` is used to schedule jobs to run at specific times, while `batch` is used to run jobs when the system load is low.
