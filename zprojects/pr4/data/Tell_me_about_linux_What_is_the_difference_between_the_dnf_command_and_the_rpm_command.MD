Linux is a free and open-source operating system built on the Unix-based operating system. It is known for its flexibility, stability, and security. DNF and RPM are both package management tools in Linux.

DNF is the newer version of the Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM) package manager. It is a high-level package manager that can resolve package dependencies automatically. DNF is a command-line tool that simplifies package installation, updates, and removal. It can download all the required packages and their dependencies from the internet and install them.

On the other hand, RPM is a low-level package management tool that can only install an RPM package file and its immediate dependencies. RPM can install, verify, update, and remove packages on the local system, but it does not handle dependencies automatically.

In summary, DNF is a higher-level package management tool that can automatically resolve dependencies and manage packages more easily than RPM. However, RPM can be useful for more advanced users who need fine-grain control over package installations and dependencies.
