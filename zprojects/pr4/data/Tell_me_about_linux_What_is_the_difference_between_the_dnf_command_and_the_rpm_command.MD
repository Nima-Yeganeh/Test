Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used in servers, personal computers, and mobile devices. It is popular for its stability, security, and ability to run on a wide range of hardware.

The dnf command and the rpm command are both used in Linux to manage the installation and removal of software packages.

DNF, or Dandified Yum, is a high-level package manager used in modern Fedora and Red Hat-based Linux distributions. It is a successor to the yum package manager. DNF performs dependency resolution and downloads and installs packages along with their dependencies from configured repositories.

On the other hand, RPM, or Red Hat Package Manager, is a low-level command-line tool used to install, query, and remove software packages in Red Hat-based Linux distributions. RPM is mainly used to manage individual software packages, and it does not handle package dependencies.

In summary, while both commands are used for software management in Linux:

- dnf is a higher-level tool that handles package dependencies and can install packages from configured repositories
- rpm is a lower-level tool that mainly deals with individual software packages and does not handle package dependencies.
