In Linux, a system Cronjob with a time and date field of "0 1 * * *" would run the task at 1:00 AM every day. The five fields in a Cronjob indicate minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week, respectively. The asterisk (*) means that the task should be run every day, and the 0 and 1 indicate the specific time of day at which the task should be run, in this case 1:00 AM.
