To see VM boot screen output on a graphical console after doing an unattended install on Linux, we need to install and configure a display manager such as Xorg, Wayland or another compatible display server. These display managers provide a graphical user interface (GUI) and allow a user to log in and interact with Linux using a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. By default, many Linux distributions come with Xorg as the display manager, but other options can be installed and configured depending on the user's requirements.
