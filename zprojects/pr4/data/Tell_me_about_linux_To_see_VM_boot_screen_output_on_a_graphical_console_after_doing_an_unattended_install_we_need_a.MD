To see VM boot screen output on a graphical console after doing an unattended install on Linux, we need to install a Virtual GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) driver. Without a Virtual GPU driver, the VM boot screen output will only be visible on the text console. Installing a Virtual GPU driver will enable the display of the boot screen output on a graphical console. This is especially useful for headless systems where the only remote access to a machine is via a graphical console.
