DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach that structures applications as a collection of small, independent services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. 

When it comes to logging, there are certain types of information that you should avoid including in your logs, such as user-sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, and social security numbers. Additionally, it's a good idea to avoid logging any type of sensitive application or system information that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to your systems. Instead, focus on logging meaningful events and metrics that can help you identify issues and optimize system performance.
