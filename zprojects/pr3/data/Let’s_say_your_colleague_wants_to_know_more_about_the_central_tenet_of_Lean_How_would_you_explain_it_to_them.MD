DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes communication, collaboration, and automation between software developers and IT operations professionals. Its main goal is to reduce the time and effort required to take new software features from development to production, while maintaining high levels of reliability and performance.

Microservices, on the other hand, are a way of designing software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service is designed to perform a single function or task, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services in the application.

As for the central tenet of Lean, it is the idea of continuous improvement. This involves constantly looking for ways to improve processes, reduce waste and inefficiencies, and increase value for customers. It also involves empowering employees at all levels of the organization to identify problems and propose solutions, fostering teamwork and collaboration, and using data and metrics to measure and track progress. Overall, the focus is on making small but consistent improvements over time, rather than trying to achieve radical changes all at once.
