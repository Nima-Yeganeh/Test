DevOps is a software development methodology that focuses on collaboration, communication, and integration between developers and IT operations. It aims to deliver high-quality software products faster and more efficiently by automating the software development pipeline.

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style where software applications are divided into smaller, independent services that can communicate through APIs. It enables organizations to build and deploy scalable, flexible, and modular applications that can adapt to changing requirements.

As for the leading social media network to keep up with DevOps news and development, I would recommend Twitter. Many influential DevOps experts and thought leaders share news, insights, and tips on this platform. Some popular hashtags to follow include #DevOps, #DevOpsDays, and #ContinuousDelivery. Additionally, you can also join LinkedIn groups dedicated to DevOps to network with other professionals and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
