DevOps is a software development philosophy that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. 

One common problem in software development that was often more apparent in monoliths is the lack of agility and scalability. Monoliths are large, complex applications that are difficult to modify, test and deploy. This makes it harder to add new features, fix bugs or scale the application as demand increases. As a result, changes to the monolith become slow and risky, resulting in longer lead times, lower quality, and ultimately, unhappy customers. This is where DevOps practices such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation come in to help overcome these challenges. By breaking the monolith into smaller, more manageable services (microservices), teams can deliver updates more frequently, with less risk, and with higher quality.
