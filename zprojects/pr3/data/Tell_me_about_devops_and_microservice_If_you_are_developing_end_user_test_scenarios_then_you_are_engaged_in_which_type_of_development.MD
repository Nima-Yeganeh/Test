DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to increase the speed and efficiency of software delivery, while also improving quality and reliability.

Microservices are a software architecture pattern where applications are broken down into a collection of loosely-coupled, independently deployable components. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific function and can be developed and updated independently of the others.

If you are developing end user test scenarios, you are likely engaged in the testing phase of the software development lifecycle, which is a part of the overall software development process. This type of development is typically referred to as testing or quality assurance.
