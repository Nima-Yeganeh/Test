DevOps is a software development approach that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve the efficiency and quality of the software development process. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach to developing software applications as a collection of small, independently deployable services.

A common problem in software development that was often more apparent in monoliths was the lack of scalability and flexibility. Monolithic applications are typically large, complex applications that are difficult to maintain and scale. This makes it difficult to add new features or make changes without disrupting the entire application. Microservices, on the other hand, provide a way to break down large applications into smaller, more manageable services that can be developed and deployed independently. This makes it easier to scale the application and add new features without disrupting other parts of the application.
