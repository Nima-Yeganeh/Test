Microservices are a software architectural style that involves breaking down a large application into smaller, independent components that can be developed and deployed separately. Each microservice is responsible for a specific function and communicates with other microservices through APIs. This approach can help to increase scalability and flexibility, as well as enable faster development and deployment cycles.
