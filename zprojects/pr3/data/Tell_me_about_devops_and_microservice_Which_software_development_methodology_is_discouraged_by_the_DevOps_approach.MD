DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation between software developers and IT operations professionals. It is intended to help organizations deliver software more quickly and reliably by breaking down barriers between these traditionally siloed teams.

Microservices, on the other hand, is a software architecture style in which complex applications are built as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of the others.

DevOps and microservices can work hand-in-hand to help organizations achieve their software development goals. DevOps provides the communication and collaboration required to ensure that these services work together in a seamless and reliable way.

As for the software development methodology discouraged by the DevOps approach, it's hard to say. DevOps is intended to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of the organization, so it may not necessarily discourage any particular methodology. However, in general, methodologies that rely heavily on documentation and strict processes may not be a good fit for a DevOps approach, as they can slow down the development process and make it harder to adapt to changing requirements.
