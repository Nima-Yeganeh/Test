DevOps is a culture, methodology, and practice that emphasizes collaboration, automation, and communication between software development and operations teams, with the goal of achieving faster and more reliable software delivery. 

Microservices is an architectural style that involves breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services, each with its own set of responsibilities and functions.

The manifesto you are referring to is the "Software Assurance Manifesto," which was created in 2009 by a group of security professionals. The manifesto emphasizes the importance of addressing security concerns throughout the software development process and promoting secure coding practices. It is not specifically focused on DevOps or microservices, but rather represents a broader call for a greater focus on software security.
