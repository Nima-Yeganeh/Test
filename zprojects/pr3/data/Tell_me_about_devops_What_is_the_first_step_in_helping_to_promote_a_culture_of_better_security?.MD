DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and IT operations teams to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. One important aspect of DevOps culture is promoting a strong security posture.

The first step in helping to promote a culture of better security in the DevOps process is to ensure that security is integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle. This means incorporating security checks and testing into the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, and making security a priority throughout the process.

It is also important to involve all stakeholders, including developers, operations teams, security personnel, and business leaders, in the security process from the beginning. This can help to ensure that everyone understands the importance of security and is committed to incorporating it into the DevOps culture.

Finally, creating a culture of continuous monitoring is vital for maintaining security in the DevOps process. This involves using tools and processes to monitor the application and infrastructure at all times and responding to any security issues that arise quickly and effectively.
