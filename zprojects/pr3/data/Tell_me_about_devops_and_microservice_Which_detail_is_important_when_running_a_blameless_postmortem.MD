DevOps is a software development approach that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

Microservices is an architectural approach in software development where applications are built as a collection of small, independent and loosely coupled services that communicate with each other through APIs.

A blameless postmortem is a process of reviewing incidents and failures that occur during software development and operations without any blame being attributed to any individual or team. The key detail that is important when running a blameless postmortem is fostering a culture of openness, transparency, and trust. This means creating an environment where people feel comfortable admitting mistakes and sharing information about incidents without fear of blame or retribution. As part of this culture, it is imperative to focus on understanding the root causes of incidents, assessing the impact, and outlining actions that need to be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. Overall, the goal of a blameless postmortem is to learn from the past and take proactive measures to prevent incidents from happening again.
