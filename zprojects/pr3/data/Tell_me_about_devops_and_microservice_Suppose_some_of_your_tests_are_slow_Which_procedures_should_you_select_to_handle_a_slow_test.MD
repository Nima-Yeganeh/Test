DevOps is a software development methodology that focuses on collaboration, communication, and automation between development teams and IT operations, with the aim of improving the quality and speed of software delivery. This is achieved by breaking down traditional silos between different teams, encouraging cross-functional collaboration, and automating the deployment pipeline.

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach to software development in which software applications are broken down into small, independent components known as services. These services are built and deployed independently, and can be scaled and maintained easily, leading to more flexible and scalable applications.

Regarding handling slow tests, there are several procedures that can be selected:

1. Identify and isolate the slow tests: Analyze the test results and identify which tests are taking an unusually long time to complete. Isolate these tests and run them separately to explore the reasons behind the slowness.

2. Optimize test data setup: Ensure that the test data setup is optimized to make the test run as fast as possible. Consider using mock data or a limited data set to run the tests.

3. Optimize test environment: Ensure that the test environment is optimized to make the test run as fast as possible. This could include tuning database queries, adding more resources to the available servers, or optimizing the test script itself.

4. Review test scripts: Review the test scripts for inefficiencies. Often, tests are slow because they are doing unnecessary work, or because they are making too many requests to external services.

5. Use parallel testing: Consider using parallel testing to speed up the execution of test cases. This means running multiple tests at the same time, which can significantly reduce execution times.

6. Use a distributed testing approach: Use a distributed testing approach to distribute the test load across multiple machines or servers. This can help to reduce the overall execution time of the test suite.
