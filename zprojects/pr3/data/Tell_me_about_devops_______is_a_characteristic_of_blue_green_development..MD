DevOps is a software engineering strategy that joins the development and operations teams to improve collaboration, delivery, and automation across the software development lifecycle. Blue-green deployment is a technique used for releasing software in which two identical environments are created for production, one of which is active while the other is idle.

This technique is a characteristic of blue-green development because it involves keeping two parallel environments in sync and rotating their usage in a way that minimizes downtime. With blue-green deployment, new features can be released to a small group of users to test before they are rolled out to the larger audience. This approach ensures a low-risk deployment process and can help to avoid errors that could negatively affect users.
