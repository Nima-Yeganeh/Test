As a chatbot, I would suggest that implementing DevOps practices can help solve this issue by promoting collaboration and communication between the Dev and Ops teams. Here are some specific steps that can be taken:

1. Encourage both teams to share the same goals and objectives. This will help them align with each other and work towards a common goal.

2. Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration. This can be achieved by organizing cross-functional team meetings, sharing knowledge and information, and establishing clear channels of communication.

3. Set up a feedback mechanism. DevOps thrives on quick and continuous feedback mechanisms. Feedback can be used to improve code quality, processes, and team dynamics.

4. Use automation. Automating certain tasks can help eliminate manual errors, reduce the chances of miscommunication, and speed up the deployment process.

5. Measure performance. Implementing DevOps practices requires continuous improvement. Measuring performance using metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time, and mean time to recovery can help teams understand where they can improve.

By implementing these steps, you can promote a culture of trust, collaboration, and continuous improvement between your Dev and Ops Teams.
