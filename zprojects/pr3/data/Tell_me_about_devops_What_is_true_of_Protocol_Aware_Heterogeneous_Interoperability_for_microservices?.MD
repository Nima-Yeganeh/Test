DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to shorten the systems development life cycle, while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

Protocol Aware Heterogeneous Interoperability for microservices is a way of making different microservices, which may use different communication protocols, interact with each other seamlessly. True interoperability between heterogeneous microservices can be tricky because they may use different communication, data, and format protocols. Protocol Aware Heterogeneous Interoperability seeks to solve this problem by allowing microservices to interact with each other in a protocol-agnostic way. In other words, this means that a microservice can communicate with other services, regardless of the transport protocol they use. This kind of interoperability is critical for the success of microservices architecture, which relies on different services that are loosely coupled and can work together seamlessly.
