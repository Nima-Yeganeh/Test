DevOps is a methodology that seeks to promote collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams in order to streamline the software delivery process. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach to building applications in which the application is broken down into smaller, independent services that work together to provide the desired functionality.

To improve the overall throughput of a service, a DevOps principle that can be applied is continuous delivery. This principle involves automating the software delivery process as much as possible, so that changes can be quickly and safely deployed into production. By automating the process, teams can reduce the time it takes to deploy new features and fix issues, and increase the overall efficiency of the software delivery process.

In addition to continuous delivery, other DevOps principles such as collaboration, monitoring, and feedback can also be applied to improve the overall throughput of a service. By working together and constantly monitoring and receiving feedback from users and stakeholders, teams can identify and address bottlenecks and improve the overall performance of the service.
