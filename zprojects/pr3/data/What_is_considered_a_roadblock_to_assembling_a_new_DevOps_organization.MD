DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between the development and IT operations teams to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. It involves automating the software delivery process, using continuous integration and continuous deployment methods and tools, and leveraging cloud infrastructure.

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that can be deployed and scaled independently. Each microservice is responsible for one business capability and communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs.

Some common roadblocks to assembling a new DevOps organization include resistance to change, lack of buy-in from senior management, siloed organizational structures, lack of expertise in tools and technology, and cultural issues related to collaboration and sharing. Overcoming these roadblocks requires a dedicated effort from the organization, including training and support for teams, a cultural shift towards a more collaborative and agile environment, and investment in the right tools and infrastructure.
