DevOps is a methodology that combines software development with IT operations. It is aimed at improving collaboration and communication between developers and operations teams in order to deliver software more efficiently and with higher quality.

Microservices are an architectural approach to building applications. They involve breaking down an application into a set of small, loosely coupled services that work together to deliver the overall functionality of the application. Each service is designed to perform a specific task and can be deployed independently from the rest of the application.

The ability to globally distribute a microservice comes from the fact that microservices are designed to be small and independent, with well-defined interfaces that allow them to communicate with each other. This makes it easy to deploy individual microservices to different locations around the world, without having to deploy the entire application. Additionally, containerization technology like Docker makes it easy to package microservices and move them between different environments. This flexibility allows organizations to build and deploy applications that are highly scalable and can easily adapt to changing business requirements.
