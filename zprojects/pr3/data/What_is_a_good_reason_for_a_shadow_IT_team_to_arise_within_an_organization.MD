DevOps is a methodology that combines development and operations teams, and emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation throughout the software development and deployment process. Microservices refer to a software architecture pattern in which applications are composed of small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

A good reason for a shadow IT team to arise within an organization is typically because the official IT team is not able to meet the needs of the business in a timely or effective manner. This may be due to bureaucracy, outdated processes, lack of resources or expertise, or simply the inability to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change. Shadow IT teams may be formed by business units, departments, or individuals who have a specific need or goal that they feel cannot be achieved through official channels. While this can be beneficial in terms of innovation and agility, it can also create security and compliance risks if not properly monitored and managed.
