DevOps is a philosophy and practice that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations professionals. It aims to streamline the software development lifecycle by breaking down silos and automating processes.

Microservices is an architectural approach to building software applications. In a microservices architecture, the application is broken down into smaller, independent services that can be developed and deployed separately. This allows for greater scalability and agility in software development.
