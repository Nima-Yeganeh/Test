DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close collaboration between development and IT operations teams.

Microservices are an approach to software development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each module or service carries out a specific function, and communication between the services is via a well-defined interface.

When software is deployed quickly into production, it means that the DevOps approach of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) has been implemented. This approach involves automating the entire software development process, including testing, building, and deployment.

With this approach, the team members make sure the application goes through complete automated testing. This testing process helps to identify any bugs or issues in the application, and the team can fix those issues before deploying the application to production. By deploying quickly and frequently, the team can quickly address any problems that might arise, which improves the overall quality of the software and helps the organization achieve its business goals faster.
