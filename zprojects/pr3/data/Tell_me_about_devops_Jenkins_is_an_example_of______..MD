DevOps is a software development methodology that focuses on collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to improve efficiency and quality of software delivery. Jenkins is an example of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool that is commonly used in DevOps processes. It allows developers to automate the testing, building, and deployment of software applications, which helps to streamline the software development process and increase productivity and reliability.
