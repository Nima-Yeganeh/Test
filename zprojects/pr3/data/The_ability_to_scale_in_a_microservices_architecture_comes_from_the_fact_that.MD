DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations, aiming to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms such as HTTP/REST.

The ability to scale in a microservices architecture comes from the fact that each service can be scaled independently based on its individual need for resources. This means that services with high demand can be scaled up while services with low demand can be scaled down, making the most efficient use of resources. Additionally, microservices can be deployed independently, allowing for faster and more frequent updates and reducing the risk of a system-wide failure. DevOps practices are essential to managing the deployment and scaling of microservices, as they involve continuous testing, integration, and delivery of code changes to ensure the reliability and availability of the system as a whole.
