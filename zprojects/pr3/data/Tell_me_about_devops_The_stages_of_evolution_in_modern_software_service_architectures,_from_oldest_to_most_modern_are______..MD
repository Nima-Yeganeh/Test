The three stages of evolution in modern software service architectures, from oldest to most modern, are: 

1) Monolithic architecture: This is the traditional approach in which all the components of the application are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit. It becomes difficult to scale individual parts of the application, which may lead to performance issues. 

2) Service-Oriented architecture (SOA): Here, the application is divided into services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. SOA allows for better scalability and reusability of components. 

3) Microservices architecture: This is the latest architecture pattern in which the application is broken down into small, independent services that are highly decoupled and communicate through APIs. Microservices offer improved scalability, resiliency, and faster deployment cycles. 

DevOps, on the other hand, is a philosophy or culture that advocates for collaboration between development and operations teams to ensure faster and more reliable software delivery. It involves the use of automation, monitoring, and feedback loops to facilitate continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of software applications.
