DevOps is a set of practices and cultural values that aims to improve collaboration, communication, and integration between software development and IT operations. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration and delivery, and the use of feedback loops to ensure a high-quality product is delivered to end-users quickly.

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is designed to perform a single business capability, and communicates with other services through APIs.

DevOps supports the elimination of silos between development, operations and other teams. Silos can hamper collaboration, operations and morale within the company because they create barriers between teams and can lead to miscommunications, delays and lack of accountability. By adopting a DevOps culture, teams become more collaborative, communication is improved, and teams can work together more efficiently towards achieving common goals. Microservices are often used in DevOps environments as they can be developed, maintained, and deployed independently, enabling teams to release new features and improvements quickly and with minimal impact on other parts of the system.
