One belief that has been disproven by organizations that utilize continuous delivery is that large, monolithic applications are easier to manage than microservices. In fact, many organizations have found that breaking applications down into smaller, more modular microservices makes them easier to deploy and maintain. With microservices, teams can focus on developing and improving individual services without worrying about breaking the entire application. Additionally, microservices allow for greater scalability, reliability, and flexibility than monolithic applications. DevOps is a software development approach that combines software development (Dev) with information technology operations (Ops) to streamline the entire development process, from planning and development to testing, deployment, and operations. The goal of DevOps is to increase collaboration and communication between different teams, automate processes, and deliver high-quality software products more quickly and efficiently.
