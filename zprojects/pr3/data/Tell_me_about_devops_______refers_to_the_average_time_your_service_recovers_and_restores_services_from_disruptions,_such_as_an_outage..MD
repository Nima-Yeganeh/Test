DevOps is a set of practices and principles that combine software development and IT operations to increase the speed and quality of software delivery. It involves collaboration between teams that traditionally worked in silos to improve communication, streamline processes, and automate tasks. The phrase the statement is referring to is "MTTR" or mean time to restore, which is a metric used to measure the average time taken to recover a system from a disruption like an outage or failure. DevOps teams aim to minimize MTTR by implementing processes and tools that increase system resiliency, reduce downtime, and improve incident response.
