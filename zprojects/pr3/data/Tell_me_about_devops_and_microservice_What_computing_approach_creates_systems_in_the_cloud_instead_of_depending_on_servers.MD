DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between software developers and IT professionals (operations) to automate the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that can be deployed separately and communicate with each other using lightweight mechanisms.

Together, DevOps and Microservices have become popular approaches for building scalable, resilient, and agile software systems in the cloud. One of the key benefits of this approach is the ability to create systems in the cloud that do not rely on physical servers. Instead, they are built with a cloud-native design that utilizes cloud services such as containers, serverless computing, and managed databases to create systems that are highly available, auto-scaling, and fault-tolerant. This approach is known as Cloud-native Computing.
