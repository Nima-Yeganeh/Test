DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams to enable faster, more efficient delivery of software and services. 

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style that involves breaking down a complex application into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled services that can be deployed and scaled independently.

The key DevOps tenet can be summarized as the continuous delivery and integration of software through collaboration and automation. This involves ensuring that development, testing, and deployment are seamless and integrated into a single process that is built on a culture of communication, collaboration, and automation. The ultimate goal of DevOps is to enable organizations to deliver high-quality software rapidly and reliably to their customers.
