DevOps and Microservices are two important software development methodologies that have gained popularity in recent years.

DevOps is a methodology that combines development and operations practices to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. It emphasizes on collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback to ensure that software is delivered quickly, reliably, and in a sustainable way.

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architecture style that involves breaking down a large software application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Microservices architecture promotes modularity, scalability, and flexibility in software development.

In terms of DevOps tools, one attribute that can be most detrimental is complexity. DevOps tools should be easy to use, understand, and integrate, otherwise, they can become a hindrance to the development process. Additionally, tools that are not flexible enough to adapt to the needs of the development team could also be detrimental. Therefore, DevOps tool should be simple, easy to use, and able to provide a seamless automation experience to improve the delivery process.
