DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. 

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style that breaks down complex applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed and deployed separately. The goal of microservices is to increase the agility, scalability, and resiliency of the overall system.

In continuous delivery, the goal of each phase is as follows:

1. Continuous Integration (CI): The goal of CI is to catch and fix errors early in the development cycle. This phase involves merging code changes into a shared repository, running automated tests, and building the application.

2. Continuous Testing (CT): The goal of CT is to ensure that the software meets the quality standards before it is released to production. It involves running various types of tests (e.g., unit, integration, acceptance) to validate the functionality, performance, and security of the application.

3. Continuous Deployment (CD): The goal of CD is to automate the release of software changes to the production environment. It involves deploying the application to a staging environment, running more tests, and then pushing the changes to production.

4. Continuous Monitoring (CM): The goal of CM is to detect and diagnose issues in the production environment. It involves monitoring the application performance, logging errors, and collecting metrics to identify potential problems.
