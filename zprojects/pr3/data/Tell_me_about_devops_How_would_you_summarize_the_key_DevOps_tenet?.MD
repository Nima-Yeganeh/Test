DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) in order to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 

The key DevOps tenet can be summarized as a cultural shift towards collaboration and communication between software development teams and IT operations teams. This involves breaking down the traditional silos and working towards the common goal of delivering high-quality software in a rapid and efficient manner. 

DevOps also emphasizes the use of automation and tools to streamline the development and deployment process, as well as the need for continuous monitoring and feedback to improve and optimize the system. Overall, the key tenet of DevOps is to create a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement to deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently.
