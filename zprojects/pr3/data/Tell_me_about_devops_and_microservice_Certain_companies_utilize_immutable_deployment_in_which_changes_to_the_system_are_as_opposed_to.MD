DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently, in close alignment with business objectives. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach to software development that involves building small, independent services that work together to create a larger application or system.

Certain companies utilize immutable deployment, in which changes to the system are replaced or updated as opposed to being modified or patched. This means that the configuration, code, and dependencies of each instance of the system are identical and never change, resulting in a more secure and stable system that is easy to maintain and update. Immutable deployment is often used in combination with microservices as each service can be deployed independently, allowing for greater flexibility and agility in the development process.
