The open source architecture Ubuntu has for modeling infrastructure and services together in the cloud is called Juju. 

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) with the goal of delivering software more quickly and reliably. DevOps allows teams to operate and iterate at a faster pace, which is important when dealing with modern software development workflows like microservices.

Microservices are a software architecture style where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Microservices enable teams to break down a large application into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to maintain and scale over time. 

DevOps and microservices are often used together to create modern, agile software development workflows that can quickly adapt to changing business needs.
