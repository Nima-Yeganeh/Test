DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. 

On the other hand, Microservices is a software architecture style in which complex applications are broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. 

The technique that allows you to purposely kill a server in order to test the resiliency of a system is called Chaos Engineering. In Chaos Engineering, engineers intentionally inject failure into a system to test how well it can recover, aiming to identify weaknesses before they can become critical problems in the real world. By doing this, they can build resilient and reliable systems that can withstand real-world pressures.
