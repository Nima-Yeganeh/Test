DevOps is a set of practices that combines development and operations to streamline the software delivery process and improve deployment speed and reliability. Microservice architecture is an approach to designing software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.

Now, if your Dev team has frequent issues with the Ops team, it can lead to a negative impact on productivity and software delivery. One way to solve this issue is to implement a DevOps culture in your organization. This means that both teams should work together as a single unit and collaborate on every stage of the software development process. 

Here are a few steps that can help to resolve the issue:

1. Develop empathy: Both teams need to understand and empathize with each other's challenges and constraints.

2. Communicate effectively: Encourage both teams to communicate frequently and transparently to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.

3. Establish clear responsibilities: Clearly define the responsibilities of each team member. This will help to avoid overlaps and confusion.

4. Use automation: Reduce the manual work by using automation tools. This will help to streamline the process, reduce errors, and save time.

5. Implement a blameless culture: Foster a blameless culture where the focus is on solving problems, not blaming individuals or teams.

By following these steps, you can foster a collaborative and productive environment, where both Dev and Ops teams can work together seamlessly.
