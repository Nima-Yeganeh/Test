DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT professionals to automate the process of software delivery and ensure continuous integration and deployment. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach that breaks down a large application into smaller, independent services that can be deployed and scaled separately, allowing for greater flexibility and agility in software development. 

The term in Lean that identifies waste that does not add value is "Muda." It refers to any type of activity that consumes resources but does not add value to the end product or service. There are typically eight types of Muda, including overproduction, waiting, defects, over-processing, excess inventory, unnecessary motion, unused talent, and unnecessary transportation. Identifying and eliminating Muda is a key focus of Lean methodology and can lead to increased efficiency and productivity in any organization.
