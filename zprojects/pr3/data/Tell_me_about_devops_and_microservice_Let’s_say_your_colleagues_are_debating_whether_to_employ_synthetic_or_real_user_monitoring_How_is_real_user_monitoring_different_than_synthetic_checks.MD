DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools aimed at increasing an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at a faster pace than traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. 

Microservices, on the other hand, are a type of software architecture that involves building applications as a collection of small, independently deployable services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms.

Now, to answer your question - Real user monitoring and synthetic checks are two different approaches to monitoring the performance of an application. 

Real user monitoring involves collecting data from actual users of the application and tracking their interactions with the system. This data can help identify performance bottlenecks and issues that users are experiencing in real time. 

Synthetic checks, on the other hand, simulate user interactions with the application and provide data on how the system is performing from the perspective of these simulated interactions. 

While both approaches have their benefits, real user monitoring is generally considered to be more accurate and reflective of actual user experiences, while synthetic checks are useful for identifying issues before they affect real users. The decision to use one approach over the other depends on the specific needs and goals of the organization.
