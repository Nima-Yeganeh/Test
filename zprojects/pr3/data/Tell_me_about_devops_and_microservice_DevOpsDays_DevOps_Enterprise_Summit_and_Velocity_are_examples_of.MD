DevOps and microservices are two related concepts but they refer to different things. 

DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to automate and streamline the software delivery process. DevOpsDays, DevOps Enterprise Summit, and Velocity are all conferences and events that focus on promoting DevOps practices, tools, and culture.

Microservices, on the other hand, is a software architecture style in which complex applications are broken down into small, independent, and loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately. Microservices architecture is often used in conjunction with DevOps practices to create more agile and scalable software systems.
