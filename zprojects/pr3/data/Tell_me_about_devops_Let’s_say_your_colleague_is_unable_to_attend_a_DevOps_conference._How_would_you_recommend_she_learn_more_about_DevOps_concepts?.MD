DevOps is a software development methodology that combines software development and operations to shorten the systems development lifecycle. It aims to improve collaboration between development and IT teams, so that software can be built, tested, and released more quickly and reliably.

If your colleague is unable to attend a DevOps conference, there are still several ways she can learn more about DevOps concepts. Some options include:

1. Online resources: There are many websites, blogs, and forums dedicated to DevOps concepts. Your colleague can search for articles, tutorials, and videos to learn more about the topic.

2. Training courses: There are many comprehensive DevOps training courses available both in person and online. Your colleague can enroll in one of these courses to gain a deeper understanding of DevOps concepts.

3. Books: There are many books written about DevOps that can provide an in-depth understanding of the principles and concepts behind the methodology.

4. Workshops and Meetups: Your colleague can join DevOps workshops and meetups in her local community to learn more about the methodology and network with professionals in the field.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your colleague's schedule, budget and learning style. Encourage her to explore different options and choose the one that works best for her.
