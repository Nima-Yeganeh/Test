DevOps unites team members from both the development and operations teams to participate in the IT service lifecycle from design to ongoing support. It is an approach that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation between software developers and IT operations professionals in order to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. 

In the context of microservices, DevOps becomes even more important because microservices involve breaking down traditional monolithic applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This requires a highly agile and collaborative approach, where developers work closely with operations team members to ensure that each service is built, tested, and deployed successfully. DevOps practices such as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automated testing, and monitoring are essential for managing microservices in a fast and efficient manner.
