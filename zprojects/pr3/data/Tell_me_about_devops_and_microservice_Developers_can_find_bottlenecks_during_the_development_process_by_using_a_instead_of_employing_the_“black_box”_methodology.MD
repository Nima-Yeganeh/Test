Developers can find bottlenecks during the development process by using a monitoring strategy instead of employing the “black box” methodology. In the context of DevOps and microservices, monitoring is essential to ensure that services are functioning properly and communicating effectively with each other. By monitoring key metrics, such as response times and error rates, developers can identify and fix issues before they cause problems for end-users. This proactive approach helps ensure a high level of service availability and a positive user experience.
