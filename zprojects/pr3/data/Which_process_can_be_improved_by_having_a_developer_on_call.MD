DevOps is a methodology that combines software development and IT operations to increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. It involves collaboration between developers, operations, and other stakeholders, as well as the implementation of various tools, practices, and processes to streamline the development and deployment of software.

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach to software design that involves developing small, independent services that can be deployed and scaled independently. This approach allows teams to build and maintain complex applications more effectively, as each service can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.

One process that can be improved by having a developer on call is incident response. When issues arise in production, it can be challenging to diagnose and resolve them quickly, especially if the person responsible for resolving the issue is not immediately available. By having a developer on call, you can ensure that there is always someone available to respond to incidents in a timely manner. This can reduce downtime and improve the overall reliability of your applications and services.
