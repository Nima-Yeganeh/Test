DevOps is a combination of software development and IT operations intended to help an organization rapidly produce high-quality software products and services. It involves automating the software delivery process and fostering a culture of collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.

A build log is a record of all the steps that occur during a software build process. Each entry in the build log describes an action that occurred during the build, such as the compilation of source code files or the creation of deployable artifacts. The build log is important because it provides a historical record of the build process that can be used for debugging and troubleshooting issues that might arise during the build process. Additionally, the build log can be used to assess the quality of the build, identify potential bottlenecks in the build process and optimize the speed and efficiency of the build process.
