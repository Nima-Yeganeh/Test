DevOps is a culture, philosophy, and set of practices that emphasizes automation, collaboration, and communication between IT teams throughout the software development lifecycle. It aims to streamline the delivery of software applications and services, improve the quality and reliability of those applications, and enable faster, more frequent releases.

Microservices, on the other hand, are a way of designing software systems as independent, modular components that can be deployed and scaled independently. Microservices architecture offers benefits such as improved scalability, flexibility, and resilience.
