DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and Information Technology Operations (Ops) in order to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. It aims to foster a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams, improve communication, automate processes, and increase efficiency.

Microservices, on the other hand, are a software architecture style in which complex applications are broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other via APIs. Each microservice focuses on performing a single business function, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately from the others.

When it comes to microservices and DevOps, the two are closely related since microservices architecture is often used in DevOps environments to achieve greater flexibility, scalability, and agility. To ensure the reliability of microservices and maintain uptime, DevOps teams must establish rigorous monitoring and testing processes, automate the deployment of microservices, and implement strategies for rapid recovery and restoration in case of disruptions. In this context, the term you are referring to is the Recovery Time Objective (RTO), which represents the target time that a system should be restored after an unplanned outage or disruption.
