DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to deliver high-quality software and infrastructure services efficiently. It involves collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders in the software delivery process.

The ability to globally distribute a microservice comes from the fact that microservices architecture is designed to be highly scalable and distributed. Each microservice can run independently of each other and can be deployed and scaled independently. This means that a microservice can be deployed in different regions or even different cloud providers to achieve global distribution. Additionally, microservices communication is typically done over the network using protocols like HTTP, which makes it easy to integrate disparate systems and to integrate with other microservices to form a global network of services.
