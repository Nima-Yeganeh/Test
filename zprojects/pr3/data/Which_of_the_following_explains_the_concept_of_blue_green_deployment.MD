DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to build, test, and deploy software more efficiently and reliably. Microservices are a software architecture style where large, monolithic applications are broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.

Blue-green deployment is a DevOps practice that involves having two identical production environments, one "blue" and one "green." At any given time, only one of the environments is live and serving traffic while the other is inactive. When a new version of software is ready to be released, it is deployed to the inactive environment (e.g., the "green" environment). Once the new deployment is tested and verified to be stable, traffic is switched over to the "green" environment, making it the live environment, while the previous "blue" environment becomes inactive. This allows for zero downtime during deployments and easy rollback if issues are discovered.
