The expression "People over process over tools" describes the core value of the Agile Manifesto, which emphasizes the importance of individuals and interactions in software development over relying solely on processes and tools. 

DevOps is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations professionals. It aims to streamline the software development process, enabling teams to release new software faster and with fewer errors.

Microservices, on the other hand, are a way of designing software applications by breaking them down into small, independent services that can be easily developed and deployed. Microservices architecture supports DevOps practices by providing a modular and scalable approach to software development and deployment.

In summary, both DevOps and microservices emphasize collaboration, agility, and a focus on delivering value to users, rather than solely relying on processes and tools.
