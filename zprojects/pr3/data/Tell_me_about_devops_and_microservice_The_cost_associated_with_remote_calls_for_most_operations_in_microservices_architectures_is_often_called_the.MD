The term you're looking for is "overhead". DevOps is a set of practices that focuses on collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams. It aims to help organizations deliver software and services at a faster rate and with greater quality. Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural style where applications are composed of independently deployable services that work together to form an application. Each microservice runs its own process and communicates with other services through APIs. The cost associated with remote calls in a microservices architecture is often referred to as "overhead", which includes things like network latency, serialization and deserialization of data, and the need for additional infrastructure to handle communication between services.
