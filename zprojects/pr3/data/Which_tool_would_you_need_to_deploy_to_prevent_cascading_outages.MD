DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle, while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. Whereas, Microservices is an approach to building software applications that focuses on decomposing complex applications into small, independent services that can be deployed, scaled and maintained independently of each other.

To prevent cascading outages in a microservice architecture, one tool that can be used for deployment is a "Canary Deployment." A Canary Deployment is a technique that involves deploying new Microservices gradually, and in small increments, alongside the existing system. This approach allows system administrators to test how the new service performs and whether it works as expected. By deploying the new services gradually, the risk of errors or bugs affecting the entire system is reduced, since any failures will only impact a small part of the system. Furthermore, system administrators can roll back changes quickly and easily if they notice any unexpected behavior or problems. Several tools that can be used to implement a Canary Deployment in a Microservice architecture include Kubernetes, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and HashiCorp Consul.
