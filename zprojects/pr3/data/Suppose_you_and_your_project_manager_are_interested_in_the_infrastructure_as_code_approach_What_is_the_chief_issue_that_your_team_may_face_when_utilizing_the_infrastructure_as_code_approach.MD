DevOps and microservices are both software development approaches that focus on the efficient and effective delivery of software applications.

DevOps is a collaborative approach that aims to unify software development and IT operations. The goal is to achieve faster and more reliable software development and deployment processes.

Microservices, on the other hand, is an architectural approach to developing software that breaks down large, monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable services.

When utilizing the infrastructure as code approach, the chief issue that your team may face is the need for skilled personnel who are adept at creating, managing, and troubleshooting code. Infrastructure as code requires that the infrastructure be defined in code, which can be subject to bugs, versioning issues, and other challenges.

Moreover, this approach requires a shift in mindset, from manual configuration to automated and programmatic management of infrastructure. This can require a significant investment in training and education to ensure that your team is fully equipped to manage infrastructure using code.
