JavaScript objects have several built-in methods that allow you to manipulate the properties and values of an object. Here are some commonly used methods:

1. Object.assign(): This method is used to copy the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

2. Object.keys(): This method returns an array of all the property names in an object.

3. Object.values(): This method returns an array of all the property values in an object.

4. Object.hasOwnProperty(): This method checks whether an object has a specific property or not.

5. Object.freeze(): This method freezes an object, preventing its properties from being added, deleted, or modified.

6. Object.seal(): This method seals an object, preventing new properties from being added and existing properties from being deleted.

7. Object.create(): This method creates a new object with a specified prototype object and properties.

By using these object methods you can perform various operations on JavaScript objects.
