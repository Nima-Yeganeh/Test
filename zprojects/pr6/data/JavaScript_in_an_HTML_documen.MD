JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity, functionality, and behavior to web pages. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and engaging websites.

In an HTML document, JavaScript code can be included within script tags in the head or body section of the document. For example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <script>
      // JavaScript code goes here
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

JavaScript can be used to perform a variety of tasks on a web page, such as handling user input, modifying the content or styling of elements on the page, and making network requests to fetch data from a server. With JavaScript, you can create dynamic and responsive web applications that can run entirely in the browser.
