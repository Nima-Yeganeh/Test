JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for creating interactive and dynamic websites.

The `element.classList.toggle()` method is a function in JavaScript that is used to add or remove a specified class from an HTML element. 

When you call `toggle()` on an element's `classList`, it will check if the specified class name is already present on the element. If it is, the method will remove the class. If it's not, the method will add the class. 

The syntax for using `classList.toggle()` is as follows:

```
element.classList.toggle("class-name");
```

where `element` is the HTML element you want to add or remove the class from, and `class-name` is the name of the class you want to add or remove.
