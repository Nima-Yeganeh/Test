JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to create interactive web pages and dynamic web applications. 

To answer your question, `var` and `let` are both used to declare variables in JavaScript, but they have different scoping rules. 

`var` has function-level scope, while `let` has block-level scope. 

In scenarios where you need to access the variable outside of a block scope, you should use `var`. On the other hand, if you want to limit the scope of the variable to a block or statement, you should use `let`. 

It is also important to note that starting from ECMAScript 6, `let` and `const` were introduced as replacements for `var`. In general, you should use `let` or `const` instead of `var` in modern JavaScript applications.
