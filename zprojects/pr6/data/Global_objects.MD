In JavaScript, global objects are objects that are available throughout the entire code and can be accessed by any function, method or code block that is defined in the code. These objects are not limited to a specific context or scope, and can be used anywhere in the code.

Some commonly used global objects in JavaScript are:

1. Math - This object provides a set of mathematical functions like `abs`, `ceil`, `floor`, `random`, etc.

2. console - This object is used for debugging purpose to print messages to the console.

3. Date - This object provides a way to work with dates and times.

4. String - This object provides a set of methods to manipulate strings.

5. Object - This is the base object from which all other objects inherit in JavaScript.

6. Array - This object represents an ordered collection of elements.

7. RegExp - This object provides a way to work with regular expressions.

8. Error - This object provides a way to handle errors in JavaScript.

These global objects are predefined in JavaScript and do not need to be imported or explicitly created.
