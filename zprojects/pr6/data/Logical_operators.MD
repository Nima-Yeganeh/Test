JavaScript Logical operators are used to combine two or more expressions into one logic expression. There are three logical operators in JavaScript:

1. && (Logical AND): It returns true if both operands are true. For example, 

   `if (a > b && c > a)`

   In the above expression, if both the operands `a > b` and `c > a` evaluate to true, then the expression will return true.

2. || (Logical OR): It returns true if one of the operands is true. For example,

   `if (a > b || c > a)`

   In the above expression, if either of the operand `a > b` or `c > a` evaluates to true, then the expression will return true.

3. ! (Logical NOT): It reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then the `!` operator will make it false and vice versa. For example,

   `if(!(a>b))`

   In the above expression, if `a` is not greater than `b`, then the expression will return true.

Logical operators are commonly used in conditional statements like if-else, while, and for loops to make decisions based on two or more conditions.
