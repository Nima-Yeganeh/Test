JavaScript provides ways to modify the classes of HTML elements dynamically. There are a few methods you can use to accomplish this:

1. `classList.add(className)` - Adds a class to an element. 
2. `classList.remove(className)` - Removes a class from an element.
3. `classList.toggle(className)` - Toggles a class on and off an element.
4. `classList.replace(oldClass, newClass)` - Replaces an existing class with a new class on the element.

Here's an example of how the `classList.add()` method can be used to add a new class to an HTML element:

```
// Get the element you want to modify
const element = document.getElementById('my-element');

// Add a class to the element
element.classList.add('new-class');
```

In this example, JavaScript selects the HTML element with an ID of `my-element` and adds a new class called `new-class` to it. You can use the other classList methods in a similar way to modify the classes of HTML elements dynamically in your web applications.
