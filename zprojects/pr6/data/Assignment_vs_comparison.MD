In JavaScript, an assignment is when you set a value to a variable using the equal sign (=), while a comparison is when you check if two values are equal or not using comparison operators like == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), or <= (less than or equal to). 

For example, with an assignment, you can set a variable x to a value of 5 like this: 

```
let x = 5;
```

With a comparison, you can check if x is equal to 5 like this: 

```
if (x == 5) {
  console.log("x is equal to 5");
}
```

In this case, if x is equal to 5, the code inside the if statement will be executed and "x is equal to 5" will be printed to the console. 

It's important to note that the double equal sign (==) is used for comparison, while a single equal sign (=) is used for assignment, and the triple equal sign (===) is used for strict equality comparison, which compares both value and data type.
