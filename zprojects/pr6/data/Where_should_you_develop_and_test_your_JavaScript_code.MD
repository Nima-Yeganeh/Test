JavaScript is a popular programming language that is typically used for creating interactive and dynamic websites. 

As for developing and testing your JavaScript code, it's generally recommended to use a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your code before testing it in a web browser.

There are many text editors and IDEs available for developers to use when working with JavaScript, such as:

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Sublime Text
3. Atom
4. Notepad++
5. WebStorm

Once you've written your code, you can test it by opening the HTML file in a web browser and checking the console for any errors. You can also use browser developer tools to help with debugging and troubleshooting your code.
