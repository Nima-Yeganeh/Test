In JavaScript, a single equals symbol (`=`) is used as an assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right-hand side of the operator to the variable on the left-hand side. For example:

```javascript
let x = 5;  // assigns the value 5 to the variable x
```

It's important to note that a single equals symbol does not test for equality. To test for equality, you should use two equals symbols (`==`). This will compare the values on both sides and return a boolean (true or false) depending on whether they are equal or not. For example:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 5;
console.log(x == y);  // logs true
```

You can also use three equals symbols (`===`) to test for strict equality, which not only compares the values but also their data types.
