In JavaScript, event listeners are used to monitor and respond to events that occur on a webpage, such as user clicks or keyboard inputs. It is often necessary to pass data or arguments to the event listener in order to perform certain actions.

To pass arguments through event listeners in JavaScript, you can use a combination of anonymous functions and the bind() method.

For example, suppose you have a button element on your webpage with an ID of "myButton". You could add an event listener to this button that passes a value of "hello" to a function called "myFunction" like this:

```
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  myFunction("hello");
});
```

In this example, a new anonymous function is created that calls the "myFunction" function and passes the argument "hello" to it.

Alternatively, you can use the bind() method to bind a specific value or object to the event listener. For example:

```
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", myFunction.bind(null, "hello"));
```

In this example, the bind() method is used to bind the value of "hello" to the "myFunction" function when it is called by the event listener. The null passed as the first argument to bind() indicates that the value of this inside myFunction will be the global object.
