JavaScript is a popular programming language for building web and mobile applications because of its versatility, user-friendliness, and ability to run on a wide variety of platforms.

In recent years, command line and automation tools have become increasingly popular in JavaScript development because they streamline and automate many of the repetitive tasks involved in building and deploying applications. For example, command line tools like npm (Node Package Manager) can be used to install and manage dependencies, run tests, and build projects.

Automation tools like Grunt, Gulp, and Webpack automate tasks like compiling, bundling, and optimizing code, which saves developers time and effort. These tools can also help ensure consistent formatting and code quality across multiple developers and projects.

Overall, command line and automation tools have become popular in JavaScript development as they help developers work more efficiently and effectively.
