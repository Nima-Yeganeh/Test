JavaScript is a popular programming language used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface used to represent and manipulate the HTML and XML documents. 

The DOM defines a hierarchical structure of nodes that represent the elements, attributes, and text content of an HTML or XML document. Using JavaScript, you can manipulate and modify the DOM elements to create dynamic and interactive web pages. 

For example, you can use JavaScript to add new HTML elements, delete existing ones, modify their attributes and content, or listen for user interactions such as clicks and keystrokes. 

Overall, the Document Object Model is an essential component of modern web development and is heavily used by JavaScript developers to create interactive and engaging web applications.
