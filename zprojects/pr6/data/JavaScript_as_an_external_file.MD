JavaScript is a programming language that is often used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. 

When using JavaScript in a web page, you have the option of including the code directly within the HTML file or linking to an external file. 

Linking to an external JavaScript file is typically preferred, as it allows for better organization and maintenance of your code. To do this, you would create a separate .js file containing your JavaScript code and then add a script tag to your HTML file that links to that external file:

```html
<script src="path/to/your/javascript-file.js"></script>
```

This will load and execute the code within the external JavaScript file, allowing you to easily access and modify your code without having to sort through HTML code.
