JavaScript data types are classified into two categories: primitive and non-primitive types.

1. Primitive Data Types:
a. Boolean – represents a logical entity and can have two values true or false.
b. Null – represents the intentional absence of any object value.
c. Undefined – property of JavaScript global object. It represents the value that isn’t assigned.
d. Number – represents a numeric value.
e. String – represents a sequence of characters.

2. Non-Primitive Data Types:
a. Object – a collection of key-value pairs.

JavaScript also has two special data types – NaN (Not a Number) and Infinity which are used to denote special numerical values.
