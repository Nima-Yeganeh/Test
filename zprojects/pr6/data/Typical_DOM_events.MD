JavaScript has a number of typical DOM (Document Object Model) events that are associated with the web pages created using HTML and CSS. These events include:

1. Click: This event occurs when an element is clicked by the user.
2. Change: This event is triggered when the value of a form element, such as a dropdown, checkbox, or radio button, changes.
3. Submit: This event is triggered when a form is submitted by the user.
4. Mouseover: This event is triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
5. Mouseout: This event is triggered when the mouse pointer moves away from an element.
6. Keydown: This event is triggered when a key on the keyboard is pressed down.
7. Load: This event is triggered when a page, image, or resource finishes loading.

These events can be used to trigger JavaScript functions that respond to user actions on a web page, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic websites.
