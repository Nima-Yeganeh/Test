JavaScript variables are essentially containers that you can use to store various types of data, such as numbers, strings, and boolean values. You can create a variable by using the keyword "var" followed by the name you want to give the variable. 

For example:
```
var myName = "John";
var age = 28;
var isMale = true;
```

You can also declare a variable without giving it a value, and assign one later:

```
var x;
x = 5;
```

Once a variable is declared, you can update its value by simply assigning a new value to it:

```
myName = "Jane";
age = 30;
isMale = false;
```

Variables can be extremely useful for storing values that you want to use throughout your JavaScript code, without having to manually type out the same value multiple times.
