To find official documentation and code examples for standard built-in (global) objects in JavaScript, you can go to the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) website. MDN has a comprehensive JavaScript documentation library that covers all aspects of the language, including the standard built-in objects. The documentation provides a detailed description of each object, its properties, methods, and usage. Additionally, the website provides code examples and interactive demos to help you understand and practice using the objects.
