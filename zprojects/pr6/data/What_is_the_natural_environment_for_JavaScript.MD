JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. The natural environment for JavaScript is the web browser, as it is a client-side scripting language that is executed by the browser on the client's computer. However, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side through platforms like Node.js. Additionally, JavaScript can be used in a variety of other environments, such as mobile app development frameworks like React Native, desktop application development using Electron, and even in Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
