One advantage of using a class over an object constructor method in JavaScript is that it provides a standardized and syntactically cleaner way of defining objects and their methods. Classes provide a way to group related properties and methods together in one place, making the code easier to understand and maintain. It also allows for the use of inheritance in a more structured and clear way than object constructors, as you can easily extend a class and its methods using the `extends` keyword. Additionally, classes offer built-in features such as constructors, static methods, and getters and setters which can be helpful for achieving certain programming goals or best practices.
