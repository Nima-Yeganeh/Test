JavaScript is a popular programming language used for creating dynamic websites and web applications. It is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed on the client-side (i.e., in the user's web browser) instead of on the server-side.

JavaScript is a high-level language with syntax that is similar to other C-style programming languages like Java and C++. It supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. 

Some of the key JavaScript language features include:

- Variables: Used to store data and values.
- Functions: Blocks of code that can be reused by calling them when needed.
- Control structures: Used to control the flow of code execution.
- Objects and arrays: Used to store and organize data in a structured way.
- Classes and constructors: Used for creating objects and defining their properties and methods.
- Event handling: Used to handle user interactions with the web page.

In addition to these basics, JavaScript also has a wide variety of libraries and frameworks available for use, making it a versatile and powerful tool for web development.
