I'm assuming you're referring to the JavaScript `let` statement.

The `let` statement was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and is used to declare a block-scoped variable in JavaScript. It's similar to the `var` statement, but unlike `var`, `let` allows you to declare a variable with block scope. 

Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block they were declared in (that could be a function, a loop, or a simple block of code). Also, `let` variables are not hoisted unlike `var` variables which mean that they can't be accessed before they are declared.

Here's a basic example:

```
{
  let x = 1;
  console.log(x); // Output: 1
}

console.log(x); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

As you can see, `x` is only accessible within the block where it was declared with `let`. Outside the block, `x` is not defined. 

Overall, `let` statements offer more control and security in your code by creating a more precise scope for your variables.
