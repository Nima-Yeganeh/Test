Yes, you can use arrow functions to create object methods in JavaScript. Here's an example:

```
const myObject = {
  myMethod: () => {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  }
};

myObject.myMethod(); // Outputs "Hello, world!"
```

In this example, we're defining an object called `myObject`, and we're defining a method called `myMethod` using an arrow function. We can then call `myObject.myMethod()` to execute the method and output "Hello, world!" to the console.
