JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) events are actions that occur in web browsers or on web pages, such as clicking a button, hovering over an image, or scrolling down a page. When a user interacts with a web page, the browser generates events that can trigger JavaScript code to respond. 

JavaScript allows developers to manipulate web pages by adding and removing elements, changing attribute values, and more, and events provide a way for developers to write code that responds to user interactions.

There are many types of DOM events, including mouse events (such as clicking, hovering, and scrolling), keyboard events (such as pressing keys), form events (such as submitting forms), and more. Developers can use JavaScript to listen for these events and write code that executes in response to them, making web pages more interactive and engaging for users.
