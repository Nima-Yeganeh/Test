JavaScript callbacks are a powerful feature of the JavaScript language. Essentially, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is meant to be called at a later time. This can be useful for handling asynchronous or long-running operations.

For example, imagine you have a function that requests data from an API. This function takes two arguments: a URL for the API endpoint and a callback function to handle the response. When the data is retrieved, your function calls the callback with the data as an argument.

Here's an example:

```
function getData(url, callback) {
  // make HTTP request to API and return data
  const data = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  callback(data);
}

function handleData(data) {
  console.log(`Received data: ${data.name}, ${data.age}`);
}

getData("http://example.com/api/data", handleData);
```

In this example, `getData` is a function that requests data from an API and takes a `url` and `callback` argument. The `callback` argument is a function that will be called with the data once it is retrieved. 

The `handleData` function is the callback that we pass to `getData`. It simply logs the data to the console.

When we call `getData` with the `url` parameter and the `handleData` callback, the function makes the HTTP request, receives data and then calls the `handleData` callback with the received data as its single argument.

This is just one example of how callbacks can be used in JavaScript. They are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations and can be used in many different scenarios.
