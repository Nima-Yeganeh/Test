JavaScript is a scripting language used for creating interactive and dynamic web content. It is commonly used for validating form data, creating drop-down menus, pop-up windows, and other user interface elements.

The DOM, or Document Object Model, is an interface that is used by JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and XML documents. Essentially, the DOM acts as a tree structure that represents the elements on a webpage, and JavaScript can access and modify these elements to create dynamic and interactive web experiences. With the help of the DOM, JavaScript can modify the content, structure, and style of a webpage in real-time, without having to reload the entire page.
