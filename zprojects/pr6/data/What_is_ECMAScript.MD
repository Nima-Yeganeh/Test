JavaScript is a popular scripting language used to build interactive web applications. It was first introduced in 1995 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

ECMAScript is a standard that specifies the rules, guidelines, and syntax that JavaScript should follow. It was created to ensure that different implementations of JavaScript would be compatible with each other. ECMAScript is maintained by the nonprofit organization, Ecma International.

JavaScript is sometimes referred to as ECMAScript because the language is based on the ECMAScript standard. Most modern browsers support the latest version of the ECMAScript standard. Web developers use ECMAScript to write code that runs on the client-side (browser) and on the server-side (Node.js).
