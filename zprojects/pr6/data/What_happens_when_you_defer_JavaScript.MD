JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. When JavaScript is added to an HTML file, it needs to be loaded and executed before the page can be displayed in the web browser. 

When you defer JavaScript, you delay its execution until after the HTML content is parsed and displayed. This can speed up the loading of a web page because the browser does not have to wait for the JavaScript to download, parse and execute before displaying the content of the page.

By deferring JavaScript, you can ensure that the content of the web page appears quickly and the user can start engaging with it while the JavaScript is loading in the background. However, you need to be careful not to defer JavaScript needed to load crucial content or that affects the appearance of the web page.
