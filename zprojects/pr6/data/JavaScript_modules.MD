JavaScript modules are a way of organizing code into separate files with the goal of improving the maintainability and reusability of the code. In JavaScript, there are two main types of modules: CommonJS modules and ES6 modules.

- CommonJS modules were introduced first and are used primarily in Node.js environments. They allow you to define a module with the "module.exports" syntax and then import it into another file using the "require" function.
- ES6 modules were introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript and are more commonly used in frontend environments. They allow you to define a module with the "export" keyword and then import it into another file using the "import" keyword.

JavaScript modules provide a way to break up a large codebase into manageable pieces, reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts and making it easier to maintain and update the code.
