JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, which means it works with object instances. An object is a collection of key-value pairs known as properties. These properties can be variables, functions, or other objects. 

In JavaScript, objects are created using object literal notation, which involves defining the object using curly braces and adding properties inside the braces. Here's an example: 

```
let car = {
  make: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Camry',
  year: 2020,
  isAvailable: true,
  drive: function() {
    console.log('The car is driving');
  }
};
```

In this example, `car` is an object with properties such as `make`, `model`, `year`, and `isAvailable`. The `drive` property is a function that can be called using `car.drive()`. 

JavaScript objects can also be created using constructor functions or the ES6 `class` syntax. These methods provide more flexibility and are useful for creating multiple instances of similar objects. 

Overall, JavaScript objects are a powerful feature of the language that allow developers to create complex data structures and execute advanced functionality.
