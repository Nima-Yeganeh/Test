JavaScript Arrow functions are a type of concise function introduced in ES6. They are commonly used to simplify complex function declarations and to make code more readable. 

Regarding the `this` keyword, arrow functions behave differently than traditional JavaScript functions. In traditional JavaScript functions, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. However, with arrow functions, `this` is bound lexically to the enclosing execution context. This means that the value of `this` inside an arrow function is the same as the value of `this` outside the arrow function.

For example:

```
function traditionalFunction() {
  console.log(this);  // logs the global object (window in a browser)
}

const arrowFunction = () => {
  console.log(this);  // logs the same object as the enclosing scope
}

traditionalFunction.call({name: "John"}); // logs { name: "John" }
arrowFunction.call({name: "John"}); // logs { name: "John" }
```

This feature of arrow functions is helpful in situations where you need to preserve the value of `this` from the parent scope.
