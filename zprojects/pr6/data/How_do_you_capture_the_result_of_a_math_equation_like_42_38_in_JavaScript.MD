In JavaScript, you can use the basic math operators such as `*` for multiplication, `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, and `/` for division to perform mathematical operations. To capture the result of a math equation like 42 * 38, you can use the following code:

```
let result = 42 * 38;
console.log(result); // outputs 1596
```
The above code declares a variable `result` and assigns it the value of the math equation. The `console.log()` function is then used to output the result to the console for display. You can substitute the equation with any other mathematical operation and use the same code to capture the result.
