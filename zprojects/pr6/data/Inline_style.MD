In JavaScript, you can use inline styles to apply styling to HTML elements directly within the HTML code. 

Inline styles are defined using the "style" attribute in an HTML tag. The "style" attribute is followed by a set of CSS style rules, written within curly braces {}.

For example, to set the background color of a div element using inline styles, you could use the following code:

```
<div style="background-color: blue;">This is a blue div.</div>
```

Inline styles can be useful for small styling adjustments or for quickly testing out different styles before adding them to a stylesheet. However, it's generally recommended to use external stylesheets or internal CSS for larger projects to keep the code separate and organized.
