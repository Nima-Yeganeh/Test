JavaScript attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. They can be used to customize the behavior of HTML elements, such as setting their width or height, changing their text color or background color, and more. Some common attributes in JavaScript include:

- id: assigns an unique identifier to an element
- class: assigns a class to an element
- style: allows you to add CSS properties to an element
- src: specifies the source URL for an image or media file
- href: specifies the URL for a link
- disabled: disables an input field or button element

In JavaScript, you can set attributes using the `setAttribute()` method, and retrieve their values using the `getAttribute()` method.
