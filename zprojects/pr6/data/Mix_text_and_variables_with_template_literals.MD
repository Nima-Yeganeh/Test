In JavaScript, template literals are a way of writing strings that allow you to mix text and variables in a more intuitive way than traditional string concatenation. 

To use a template literal, you enclose the string in backticks (`) instead of quotation marks. Inside the string, you can include placeholders for variables by wrapping them in a ${} syntax. For example:

```
const myName = 'Alice';
console.log(`Hello, my name is ${myName}.`);
```

In this example, the variable `myName` is included inside the string using the ${} syntax. When the code is run, the output will be:

```
Hello, my name is Alice.
```

Using template literals can make your code more readable and easier to write by reducing the number of string concatenation operations you need to perform. It also allows for dynamic and complex string creations.
