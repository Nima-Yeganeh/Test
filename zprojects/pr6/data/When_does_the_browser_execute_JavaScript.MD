JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages. 

The browser executes JavaScript code whenever a web page that contains JavaScript is loaded. JavaScript code is executed directly in the browser on the client-side. This means that the browser processes the JavaScript code while rendering the web page, and the resulting code is executed within the environment of the web page. 

JavaScript code can be included in an HTML document in a number of ways, including inline, embedded within a page, or referenced in a separate file. When the web page is loaded, the browser processes the JavaScript code and executes it in the appropriate order. 

It is worth noting that for security purposes, modern browsers have some restrictions on how JavaScript can interact with the page and the user's computer. Scripts are typically prevented from accessing the client's file system, for example, and pop-up windows or other intrusive behavior are usually blocked or heavily regulated.
