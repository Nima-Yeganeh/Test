JavaScript has two types of scope: global scope and local scope. 

Global scope refers to variables that are declared outside of functions and can be accessed from anywhere within the code. These variables have a global scope and are available throughout the entire program. 

Local scope, on the other hand, refers to variables that are declared inside a function and can only be accessed from within that particular function. These variables have a local scope and cannot be accessed from outside the function. They exist only within the function's block of code. 

It is important to understand scope in JavaScript because knowing the scope of a variable helps you to avoid issues like naming conflicts and unintended side effects.
