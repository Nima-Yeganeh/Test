In JavaScript, the established convention for formatting objects is using the object literal notation. This involves defining objects in a key-value pair format, where keys are strings or symbols and values can be of any type, including functions. The object is enclosed inside curly braces {} and each property is separated by a comma. Here is an example of an object defined using the object literal notation:

```
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Developer"
};
```

It's important to note that in JavaScript, there are other ways to create objects, such as using the constructor function or the class syntax, but the object literal notation is widely used and considered to be the simplest and most concise way to define objects.
