A JavaScript React component is a block of reusable code that can be used to create elements of a user interface. React components are written in JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. They are highly modular, meaning they can be combined and nested to create complex and interactive user interfaces that are easy to maintain. In addition to being reusable, React components are also composable, meaning they can be combined with other components to create more complex UI elements. Overall, React components offer a highly efficient and flexible way to build modern web applications.
