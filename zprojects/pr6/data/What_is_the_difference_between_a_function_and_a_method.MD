JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive websites.

A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task. It is a standalone block of code that can be called and executed multiple times. Functions can accept parameters (or arguments) and return values.

A method is a function that is associated with an object. It is similar to a function in that it performs a specific task, but it operates on the data of an object and can only be called on that particular object. Methods are defined inside the object and can access and modify the object's data.

The main difference between a function and a method is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.
