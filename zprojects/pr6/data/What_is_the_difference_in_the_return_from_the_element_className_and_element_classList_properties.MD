JavaScript is a programming language used for creating interactive websites and web applications. 

`element.className` returns a string containing the value of the `class` attribute of the specified element. If the element has multiple classes, they are returned as a string separated by spaces. However, it doesn't provide any functionality to manipulate individual classes.

`element.classList` returns a DOMTokenList object representing the `class` attribute of an element. It provides methods like `add`, `remove`, `toggle`, `contains` to manipulate individual classes. This makes it easier to add, remove or toggle classes on an element without having to modify the entire class attribute. 

So, the key difference is that `element.className` returns a string of all classes on an element, while `element.classList` provides an object that can be used to manipulate individual classes.
