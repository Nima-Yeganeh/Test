JavaScript Linting is the process of statically analyzing the code to find potential errors and enforce a consistent coding style. A linter is a tool that programmers use to detect programming errors, bugs, and other common mistakes in code. Linters can help developers write cleaner, more error-free code, and speed up the development process.

On the other hand, code formatting is all about how the code looks, rather than how it functions. Code formatting deals with spacing, indentation, line length, and other aspects of how code is laid out. Code formatting ensures that code is consistent and easy to read for other developers.

In VSCode, you can use extensions like ESLint, Prettier, and standard.js to lint and format your code automatically. These tools help make the code more consistent, readable, and maintainable.
