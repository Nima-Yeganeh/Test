Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

A JavaScript function is a block of code that performs a specific task. An advanced function can be created using advanced techniques such as closures, recursion, higher-order functions, and more.

Here is an example of an advanced JavaScript function that uses closure:

```
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

// Using the closure function
const addFive = add(5);
console.log(addFive(7)); // Output: 12
```

In the example above, the `add()` function creates a closure by creating and returning a new function that uses the `a` parameter from the parent function. We then use the closure function `addFive` to add 5 to any number passed as an argument.

Another example of an advanced JavaScript function could be a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```
function factorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

// Using the factorial function
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

In the example above, the `factorial()` function is a recursive function that calls itself until the base case is reached (when n equals 1). The function then returns the product of `n` and the result of calling `factorial(n - 1)`.

There are many other advanced techniques and approaches to building JavaScript functions, but these two examples should give you a good starting point.
