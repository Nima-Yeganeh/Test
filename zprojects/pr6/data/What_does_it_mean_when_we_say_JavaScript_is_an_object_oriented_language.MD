JavaScript is primarily an object-oriented language that is widely used to create interactive web pages and web applications. Being an object-oriented language means that a lot of the functionality and behavior of JavaScript is encapsulated within objects. 

In object-oriented programming, an object is a representation of a real-world entity or concept that has properties, methods, and events. Properties are the characteristics or attributes of objects that describe their state, while methods are the functions or actions that objects can perform. Events are triggered in response to actions or behaviors of objects.

In JavaScript, objects are created using the object literal notation or using constructors and prototypes. With object literals, you can define an object and its properties and methods in one go. With constructors and prototypes, you can create multiple instances of an object and inherit properties and methods from a prototype object.

Overall, object-oriented programming in JavaScript allows for code reusability, modularity, and extensibility, making it a popular choice for building complex web applications.
