JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity, functionality and dynamic behavior to web pages. 

When you write code in the browser console, the code runs on your local machine (client-side) and affects the website as long as it's in the current session. This can include modifying the content and styling of the website, as well as manipulating and processing data.

However, any changes made using the browser console are not permanent and will not be saved when the website is reloaded or accessed by other users. Additionally, if the website has any security measures in place, the console may not be able to perform certain actions or access certain data.
