Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. With Terraform, you can create and manage a wide range of cloud resources across multiple platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and more, with one unified language. Terraform uses a declarative configuration file to define the desired state of your infrastructure, which it then applies to create and manage your resources. This allows for improved reproducibility, scalability, and ease of collaboration among teams. Additionally, Terraform supports features such as infrastructure as code, state management, and resource dependencies, making it a powerful tool for managing complex infrastructure.
