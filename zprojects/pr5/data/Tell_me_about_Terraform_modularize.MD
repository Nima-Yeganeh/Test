Terraform is a popular infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud resources in a declarative manner. One of the key benefits of Terraform is the ability to modularize your code, which allows you to reuse code and reduce duplication. 

Modularizing Terraform code involves breaking your configuration into reusable modules that can be shared across multiple projects. Modules encapsulate a group of related resources and can be either public or private. 

To create a Terraform module, you need to create a separate directory with its own main.tf file that defines the resources within the module. You can then pass variables to the module and call it from within your main Terraform configuration file using a module block. 

Modularizing your Terraform code provides several benefits, including improved code organization, increased reusability, and easier maintenance. It also helps promote best practices and consistency across projects and provides greater flexibility when managing complex infrastructure.
