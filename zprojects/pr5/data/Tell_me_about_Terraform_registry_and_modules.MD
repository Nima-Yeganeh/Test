The Terraform registry is a public repository that contains a variety of modules, plugins, and provider configurations that are used to manage cloud infrastructure using Terraform. These modules are pre-built infrastructure configurations that provide a easy-to-use, repeatable, and standardized way to manage resources across different cloud providers.

Modules on the Terraform registry are reusable components that can be imported into different Terraform configurations. This allows users to take advantage of code thatâ€™s already been written to manage common types of resources, such as compute instances, storage containers, databases, and more.

By using modules from the Terraform registry, users can save time and effort, reduce the risk of errors, and ensure that their infrastructure is consistent and efficient. Overall, the Terraform registry and modules are powerful and flexible tools for managing cloud infrastructure with Terraform.
