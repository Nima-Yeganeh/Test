Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that enables users to define and provision infrastructure as code. Terraform uses reusable codeblocks called modules to simplify infrastructure management. Terraform modules are self-contained blocks of Terraform that can be shared and re-used across infrastructure deployments.

Using Terraform modules provides a number of benefits, including:

1. Reusability: Terraform modules enable IT teams to define and reuse configurations and infrastructure components, which helps in managing large scale production environments.

2. Composition: Terraform modules make it easier to combine existing infrastructure components into new modules that can be used to describe new infrastructure.

3. Sharing: Terraform modules can be shared across multiple teams and projects, making it easier to collaborate and share best practices.

With Terraform modules, you can define complex infrastructure using code, which can be tested and versioned like any other codebase. This helps in eliminating manual errors and ensures that your infrastructure is always up-to-date even as requirements change over time.
