Terraform registry is a central repository of Terraform modules, which are pre-built scripts that help to automate and manage infrastructure resources in an organization. It enables users to quickly search and download modules for popular cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Providers on the other hand are plugins that allow Terraform to interact with different infrastructure platforms and services. Terraform supports over hundreds of providers, ranging from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, to on-premise providers like VMware and Kubernetes.

Using providers, developers can specify the infrastructure resources they need and then use Terraform to create, manage, and delete those resources in a repeatable and scalable way. By combining the Terraform registry and providers, organizations can speed up their infrastructure deployment and management processes.
