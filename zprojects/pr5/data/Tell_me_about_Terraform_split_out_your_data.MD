Terraform is a popular infrastructure automation tool used to manage cloud resources. You can split your data in Terraform using the module structure. A module in Terraform is a self-contained package of Terraform configurations which can be shared and re-used across different projects. 

To split out data in Terraform, you can create a separate configuration file for your data and reference it in your main module. This approach is useful when you have a large or complex set of data that you want to manage separately. 

Here's an example of how you can split out your data in Terraform:

1. Create a file named "data.tf" in the root directory of your Terraform project.

2. In the "data.tf" file, define your data in the appropriate format. For example, if you're managing AWS resources, you might define a data source to retrieve information about your Amazon S3 buckets.

3. In your main Terraform module, reference the data source using the module syntax. For example, if you want to create a resource that depends on the S3 bucket data you defined, you would reference it like this: 

   ```
   module "my_s3_data" {
     source = "./data.tf"
   }
   
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     // ...
     // Use variables from the my_s3_data module
     // ...
   }
   ```

This way, you can structure your Terraform project in a way that separates your data from your main configuration, making it more manageable and maintainable.
