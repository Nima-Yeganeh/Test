Terraform Plan is a command in Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool, that is used to create, change, and manage infrastructure across various cloud providers and on-premises systems. 

The Terraform Plan command's main purpose is to create an execution plan that shows how Terraform will apply changes to the configuration files and infrastructure. This is done without actually creating or modifying any resources. The plan provides you with visibility and insight into what changes will be made to your infrastructure and can be used to review and confirm these changes before they are applied.

The Terraform Plan command also shows you any errors or warnings in your configuration files, which can help you detect and correct issues before they show up in your actual infrastructure.

In summary, a Terraform Plan command generates a preview of the changes that Terraform will apply to your infrastructure based on your current configuration files. It gives you an opportunity to review and understand these changes before you apply them.
