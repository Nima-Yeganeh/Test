Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IAC) tool that allows you to manage your infrastructure resources using code. Once you have created your infrastructure, you may need to make changes or even get rid of it completely. When you need to clean up and destroy your infrastructure, Terraform provides you with the tools you need to do so efficiently and effectively.

To clean up and destroy resources in Terraform, you will use the "terraform destroy" command. With this command, Terraform will identify all the resources that were created by your script and remove them. This process is known as "teardown" or "de-provisioning" and is the opposite of "provisioning" which is the process of building infrastructure.

It's essential to keep in mind that performing a "terraform destroy" command permanently deletes any resources that were created by your script, so it's critical to ensure that you do not mistakenly destroy something that is still in use or required for other systems to function correctly. Before executing a "terraform destroy," you should also confirm that this is your intention and that you have a backup of any essential data. 

Overall, Terraform makes it easy to clean up and destroy infrastructure resources in an efficient and secure way, ultimately allowing you to manage your infrastructure more effectively.
