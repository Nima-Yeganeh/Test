Terraform states are an important part of using Terraform to manage infrastructure as code. Terraform state is a representation of the resources that Terraform is managing in a particular project. The state allows Terraform to manage these resources and make changes as needed.

The state is stored in a file, typically named `terraform.tfstate` and is usually stored in a backend such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or HashiCorp's Terraform Enterprise. The state file is used to store information about the resources that Terraform is managing, such as the current status, version, and configuration of each resource. 

When Terraform creates a new resource, it records the details of that resource in the state file. When Terraform updates an existing resource, it modifies the details in the state file accordingly. 

It's important to keep the state file in a safe and easily accessible place since it contains sensitive information, such as passwords, access keys, and other credentials. Proper management of Terraform state is vital to ensure that your Terraform deployments remain consistent and that changes are tracked effectively.
