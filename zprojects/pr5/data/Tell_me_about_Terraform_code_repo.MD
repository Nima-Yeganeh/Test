Terraform code repo refers to a repository that contains the code for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define infrastructure as code and manage it in a version-controlled manner. 

The Terraform code repo is a centralized location where all the Terraform code that defines your infrastructure is stored. This includes all the infrastructure resources you intend to manage with Terraform, such as servers, load balancers, databases, and networks. 

By having a Terraform code repo, you can version control your infrastructure code and use continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) to automate deployments. This enables you to manage infrastructure changes and deployments in a structured and repeatable manner. You can also use Terraform modules to define reusable infrastructure components that can be shared across multiple projects.
