Terraform style refers to the accepted conventions and best practices for writing Terraform configuration files. These style guidelines are intended to make your Terraform code more readable, maintainable, and efficient. Some key principles of Terraform style include:

1. Consistency: It's important to maintain consistent formatting, indentation, and naming conventions throughout your code. This makes it easier for others to understand and contribute to your project.

2. Modularization: Breaking your code into reusable modules helps keep your code organized and makes it easier to reuse across different projects.

3. Resource grouping: Grouping related resources together in your code can help make it more readable and organized. This can be achieved through the use of modules or by simply grouping related resources together in your main configuration file.

4. Idempotence: Terraform is designed to be idempotent, which means that running the same configuration multiple times should produce the same result. Ensuring that your code is written in an idempotent way will help avoid unexpected changes to your infrastructure.

5. Documentation: Including clear and detailed comments in your code can help others to understand your thought process and intentions. It can also make it easier to update and maintain your code in the future.

Following Terraform style guidelines can help to ensure that your code is well-organized, efficient, and easy to maintain.
