Sure, I can provide some common Nagios interview questions and their answers:

1. What is Nagios?

Nagios is an open-source monitoring tool that helps to monitor the health and performance of IT infrastructure components, such as servers, network devices, and applications. It provides real-time alerts and notifications when problems occur, allowing IT teams to quickly identify and resolve issues.

2. What are the benefits of using Nagios?

The benefits of using Nagios include:

- Proactive monitoring of IT infrastructure components
- Real-time alerts and notifications for faster problem resolution
- Customizable monitoring plugins and checks
- Centralized monitoring and management of multiple systems
- Support for both active and passive monitoring
- Extensible architecture with a large community of plugins and addons

3. How does Nagios work?

Nagios works by using monitoring plugins to check the status and health of IT infrastructure components. These plugins can be customized to check various metrics, such as CPU usage, disk space, and network connectivity. The Nagios Core server runs checks on the monitored components and sends alerts and notifications when problems are detected.

4. What is a service check in Nagios?

A service check in Nagios is a monitoring plugin that checks the status and health of a specific service or application running on a server or network device. For example, a service check could monitor the status of a web server by checking its HTTP response code or the availability of a database by checking its connection status.

5. What is the difference between active and passive checks in Nagios?

Active checks in Nagios are performed by the Nagios Core server, which sends requests to monitored components to check their status and health. Passive checks, on the other hand, are performed by the monitored components themselves, which send results to the Nagios Core server. Passive checks are useful for monitoring components that cannot be queried by the Nagios Core server, such as network devices that only send data when a problem occurs.

6. How do you configure email alerts in Nagios?

To configure email alerts in Nagios, you need to do the following:

- Install and configure an email client on the Nagios Core server
- Configure the Nagios notification commands to use the email client
- Configure the Nagios contacts to receive email notifications
- Add the notification commands to the appropriate service and host definitions

7. What is the purpose of the Nagios web interface?

The Nagios web interface provides a graphical user interface for managing and monitoring the Nagios Core server. It allows users to view the status of monitored components, configure monitoring settings, and access reports and dashboards. The web interface is also used to configure user accounts and permissions for accessing the Nagios system.

There are many monitoring plugins available for Nagios, but here are some of the most common ones:

1. check_ping: This plugin checks the availability and latency of a network device using ICMP ping requests.

4. check_tcp: This plugin checks the availability and response time of TCP services on a network device.

5. check_ssh: This plugin checks the availability and response time of SSH services on a network device.

6. check_snmp: This plugin checks the status and performance of network devices using SNMP queries.

7. check_load: This plugin checks the system load average on a local or remote system.

8. check_cpu: This plugin checks the CPU usage and load on a local or remote system.

9. check_ntp_time: This plugin checks the time synchronization of NTP servers.

10. check_dns: This plugin checks the availability and response time of DNS servers.

Note that there are many other plugins available for Nagios, and users can also create their own custom plugins to monitor specific applications or services.


Yes, there are several plugins specifically designed for monitoring database servers with Nagios. Here are some examples:

4. check_oracle_health: This plugin checks the status and performance of Oracle database servers. It can check the availability of the server, the status of replication, and the performance of queries.

5. check_db2: This plugin checks the status and performance of IBM DB2 database servers. It can check the availability of the server, the status of replication, and the performance of queries.

Note that there are many other plugins available for monitoring database servers with Nagios, and users can also create their own custom plugins to monitor specific database applications or services.


Yes, there are several plugins available for monitoring NoSQL databases with Nagios. Here are some examples:

1. check_mongodb: This plugin checks the status and performance of MongoDB NoSQL database servers. It can check the availability of the server, the status of replication, and the performance of queries.

2. check_redis: This plugin checks the status and performance of Redis NoSQL database servers. It can check the availability of the server, the status of replication, and the performance of queries.

3. check_cassandra: This plugin checks the status and performance of Apache Cassandra NoSQL database servers. It can check the availability of the server, the status of replication, and the performance of queries.

4. check_influxdb: This plugin checks the status and performance of InfluxDB time-series database servers. It can check the availability of the server and the performance of queries.

Note that there are many other plugins available for monitoring NoSQL databases with Nagios, and users can also create their own custom plugins to monitor specific NoSQL database applications or services.


Certainly! Here are some resources and tutorials that can help you create custom plugins for monitoring NoSQL databases with Nagios:

1. Nagios Plugin Development Guidelines: This guide provides a detailed overview of the Nagios plugin development process, including how to write custom plugins for monitoring various types of services and applications.

2. Nagios Plugin API: This documentation provides an overview of the Nagios plugin API, including how to write custom plugins using the API.

When monitoring HTTP services using Nagios, the check_http plugin returns various error codes depending on the status of the HTTP service being monitored. Here are some common error codes and their meanings:

- 0: OK - The HTTP service is responding and functioning normally.
- 1: WARNING - The HTTP service is responding, but there is a warning condition. For example, the response time is slow or the HTTP response code is not what was expected.
- 2: CRITICAL - The HTTP service is not responding or is responding with an error. For example, the server is down or the HTTP response code is a server error.
- 3: UNKNOWN - The status of the HTTP service is unknown or could not be determined. This can occur if there is an issue with the plugin or the monitoring environment.

Note that the specific HTTP response code that triggers a warning or critical error can be configured using the "-e" option in the check_http plugin command. For example, "-e 404" would trigger a critical error if the HTTP response code is 404 (Not Found).


When monitoring web services using Nagios, it's important to understand the various HTTP error codes that can be returned by the web server. Here are some common HTTP error codes and their meanings:

- 200 OK: The request was successful and the server returned the requested data.
- 300 Multiple Choices: The requested resource has multiple choices and the user agent can select one of them.
- 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has moved permanently to a new URL.
- 302 Found: The requested resource has moved temporarily to a new URL.
- 400 Bad Request: The request was invalid or could not be understood by the server.
- 401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication or the user does not have the necessary permissions.
- 403 Forbidden: The server denied access to the requested resource.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- 502 Bad Gateway: The server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- 503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or maintenance.
- 504 Gateway Timeout: The server acting as a gateway or proxy did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

Note that there are many other HTTP error codes, but these are some of the most common ones that are relevant for web service monitoring with Nagios.
