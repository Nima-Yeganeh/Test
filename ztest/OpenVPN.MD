OpenVPN is an open-source VPN (Virtual Private Network) solution that provides secure and private connections between two networks over the Internet. OpenVPN uses a custom protocol that combines the security of SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) with the flexibility of VPN technologies.

OpenVPN uses port number 1194 by default for both TCP and UDP protocols. This port is used for the initial connection establishment and data transfer between the OpenVPN client and server. However, this port number can be customized in the OpenVPN configuration file if needed.

In addition to the default port, OpenVPN also uses several other ports for various purposes, such as:

- Port 443: This is the default port used for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) traffic, and OpenVPN can be configured to use this port to bypass firewalls that block other VPN ports.

- Port 943: This port is used for the OpenVPN Access Server web interface.

- Port 943/udp: This port is used for OpenVPN Access Server's UDP-based VPN.

- Port 1197: This port is used for OpenVPN Access Server's TCP-based VPN.

- Port 1198: This port is used for OpenVPN Access Server's UDP-based VPN.

- Port 7505: This port is used for OpenVPN Access Server's P2P (peer-to-peer) functionality.

Note that these port numbers are the default values used by OpenVPN, but they can be customized in the OpenVPN configuration file if needed. Also, some firewalls and network devices may block these ports by default, so it is important to ensure that these ports are open and accessible for OpenVPN traffic if you are using them.
