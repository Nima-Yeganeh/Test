Sure, here are some sample answers to the Zabbix interview questions I listed earlier:

1. What is Zabbix and what are its key features?

Zabbix is an open-source monitoring software that is used to monitor and track the performance of networks, servers, applications, and services. It provides a unified platform to monitor various metrics and allows users to create custom dashboards, set up alerts, and generate reports. Some of its key features include auto-discovery, web monitoring, customizable dashboards, notification and alerting, and a flexible user interface.

2. How does Zabbix agent work?

The Zabbix agent is a small program that runs on the system to be monitored. It collects system performance data and sends it to the Zabbix server or proxy for processing and analysis. The agent can also execute commands remotely, allowing the server or proxy to control certain aspects of the monitored system.

3. What is the difference between Zabbix server and Zabbix proxy?

The Zabbix server is the central component of the Zabbix system that receives and processes monitoring data from agents and proxies. It stores the data in a database and generates alerts and reports based on pre-defined triggers and thresholds. The Zabbix proxy is an optional component that can be used to cache and aggregate monitoring data from remote locations. It can reduce the load on the central Zabbix server and improve performance by collecting and processing data closer to the monitored systems.

4. How would you monitor a Linux server using Zabbix?

To monitor a Linux server using Zabbix, you would need to install the Zabbix agent on the server and configure it to communicate with the Zabbix server or proxy. You would then create items in Zabbix to monitor various performance metrics, such as CPU usage, disk space, and memory usage. You can also create triggers to generate alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded, and configure dashboards and reports to visualize the data.

5. What is a Zabbix item and how is it defined?

A Zabbix item is a specific metric that is monitored by the Zabbix agent or proxy. It can be a system performance metric, such as CPU usage or disk space, or an application-specific metric, such as the number of users logged in to a web application. An item is defined by specifying the type of data it will collect, the key that identifies the data, and the interval at which the data will be collected.

6. What is a Zabbix trigger and how is it defined?

A Zabbix trigger is a condition that is defined to generate an alert when a specific event or threshold is met. It is defined by specifying the item that will be monitored, the condition that will trigger the alert, and the action that should be taken when the trigger is activated. For example, a trigger could be defined to generate an alert when the CPU usage on a server exceeds 90% for more than 5 minutes.

7. What is a Zabbix template and how is it used?

A Zabbix template is a pre-defined set of items, triggers, graphs, and other configuration parameters that can be applied to multiple hosts to simplify monitoring and management. It is used to create a standardized monitoring configuration that can be easily replicated across multiple systems. Templates can be customized to meet specific requirements and can be applied to hosts manually or automatically.

8. How would you troubleshoot if a Zabbix agent is not sending data to the Zabbix server?

To troubleshoot if a Zabbix agent is not sending data to the Zabbix server, you would need to check the Zabbix agent log file for any error messages or warnings that may indicate why the agent is not sending data. You would also need to verify that the Zabbix agent configuration file is set up correctly, including the `Server=` and `Hostname=` settings. Additionally, you would need to verify that the Zabbix server or proxy is running and able to receive data from the agent, and that any firewall or network settings are not blocking communication between the agent and the server or proxy.

9. How would you configure Zabbix to monitor a network switch?

To configure Zabbix to monitor a network switch, you would need to install the Zabbix agent on the switch or use SNMP to collect data from the switch. You would then create items in Zabbix to monitor various performance metrics, such as bandwidth usage, packet loss, and interface status. You can also create triggers to generate alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded, and configure dashboards and reports to visualize the network performance data.

10. How would you configure Zabbix to send alerts when a trigger is activated?

To configure Zabbix to send alerts when a trigger is activated, you would need to configure the Zabbix server or proxy to send notifications to the appropriate users or groups. This can be done by setting up a media type, such as email or SMS, and creating an action that will be triggered when the trigger is activated. The action will then send a notification to the specified users or groups using the configured media type. You can also configure notification escalations to ensure that alerts are sent to multiple usersif the trigger is not resolved within a certain time frame.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up notification escalations in Zabbix:

1. Create a user group:
First, you need to create a user group that will receive the notifications. Go to "Administration" > "Users" and click on "Groups". Click on "Create group" and give it a name, such as "Escalation Group". Add the appropriate users to the group.

2. Create a media type:
Next, you need to create a media type that will be used to send the notifications. Go to "Administration" > "Media types" and click on "Create media type". Choose the appropriate type of media, such as email or SMS, and configure the settings.

3. Create an action:
Now, you need to create an action that will trigger the notification escalation when a trigger is activated. Go to "Configuration" > "Actions" and click on "Create action". Give the action a name and choose the appropriate conditions that will trigger the escalation, such as "Trigger value is greater than X for Y minutes". Under "Operations", add the media type you created in step 2 and the user group you created in step 1. Set the "Escalation period" to the amount of time you want to wait before sending the escalation notification. You can add multiple escalation levels by clicking on "Add" under "Operations" and configuring the media type and user group for each level.

4. Link the action to a trigger:
Finally, you need to link the action to a trigger. Go to "Configuration" > "Hosts" and choose the host you want to monitor. Click on the "Triggers" tab and choose the trigger you want to link the action to. Under "Actions", click on "Add" and choose the action you created in step 3. Save the changes.

With these steps, you have set up notification escalations in Zabbix. When a trigger is activated, Zabbix will wait for the specified amount of time before sending the notification to the first escalation level. If the trigger is still active after the escalation period, Zabbix will send the notification to the second level, and so on.


Here are the default port numbers and services used by Zabbix:

1. Zabbix server:
The default port number used by the Zabbix server is 10051. This port is used by Zabbix agents to send monitoring data to the server.

2. Zabbix agent:
The default port number used by the Zabbix agent is 10050. This port is used by the Zabbix server or proxy to collect monitoring data from the agent.

3. Zabbix web interface:
The default port number used by the Zabbix web interface is 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. These ports are used to access the Zabbix web interface through a web browser.

4. Zabbix proxy:
The default port number used by the Zabbix proxy is 10051. This port is used by Zabbix agents to send monitoring data to the proxy.

5. Zabbix Java gateway:
The default port number used by the Zabbix Java gateway is 10052. This port is used by the Zabbix server to communicate with Java applications.

It's important to note that these default port numbers can be changed in the Zabbix configuration files if necessary. Additionally, other services may be required depending on the specific monitoring setup, such as SNMP for network monitoring or IPMI for hardware monitoring.

To change the default port numbers in the Zabbix configuration files, follow these steps:

1. Open the Zabbix configuration file:
The Zabbix configuration files are located in the /etc/zabbix/ directory. The main configuration file is called zabbix_server.conf for the server or zabbix_proxy.conf for the proxy. Use your preferred text editor to open the appropriate file.

2. Locate the port number setting:
In the configuration file, search for the "ListenPort" setting. This setting specifies the port number used by the Zabbix server or proxy to listen for incoming connections. By default, the value is set to 10051 for the server and 10051 for the proxy.

3. Change the port number:
To change the port number, simply modify the value of the "ListenPort" setting to the desired port number. Make sure to choose a port number that is not already in use by another application. For example, to change the server port number to 12345, you would change the line to read "ListenPort=12345".

4. Save the configuration file:
After making the changes, save the configuration file and exit your text editor.

5. Restart the Zabbix server or proxy:
Finally, you need to restart the Zabbix server or proxy to apply the changes. Use the appropriate command to restart the service, such as "systemctl restart zabbix-server" for the server or "systemctl restart zabbix-proxy" for the proxy.

That's it! The Zabbix server or proxy will now listen on the new port number specified in the configuration file. Remember to update any other components that need to communicate with the server or proxy, such as agents or proxies, to use the new port number.


Zabbix can monitor web servers and databases using various methods, such as agent-based monitoring, SNMP, JMX, and custom scripts. Here's a brief overview of how Zabbix can monitor web servers and databases:

1. Web server monitoring:
