NRPE, or Nagios Remote Plugin Executor, is a plugin that allows Nagios to execute plugins on remote Linux/Unix machines. It is used to monitor local resources on a remote system, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network connectivity.

The NRPE plugin consists of two parts: the NRPE daemon, which runs on the remote system, and the NRPE plugin, which is installed on the Nagios server. The NRPE daemon listens for requests from the Nagios server and executes the requested plugins. The NRPE plugin on the Nagios server sends requests to the NRPE daemon on the remote system and receives the results.

NRPE allows for more detailed monitoring of remote systems, since it allows Nagios to monitor resources that are not accessible through standard monitoring methods, such as SNMP or SSH. It also allows for more secure monitoring, since the NRPE daemon can be configured to only accept requests from authorized IP addresses or hostnames.

NRPE is widely used in Nagios monitoring environments and is available as a free and open-source plugin. It is compatible with a wide range of Linux/Unix operating systems and is easily configurable using standard configuration files.

Sure! Here is an example of how NRPE can be used in a monitoring environment:

Suppose you have a Nagios monitoring server and several remote Linux servers that you want to monitor. One of the remote servers is running a critical application that requires close monitoring of its resources. You want to monitor the CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage of this server, but you cannot use SNMP or SSH to monitor these resources.

To monitor the resources of the remote server, you install the NRPE daemon on the remote server and the NRPE plugin on the Nagios monitoring server. You then configure the NRPE daemon to allow requests from the Nagios monitoring server and to execute the required plugins.

On the Nagios monitoring server, you configure the NRPE plugin to send requests to the NRPE daemon on the remote server and to receive the results. You specify the plugins to be executed, such as check_cpu_usage, check_memory_usage, and check_disk_space.

When the Nagios monitoring server executes the NRPE plugin, it sends a request to the NRPE daemon on the remote server, which in turn executes the specified plugins and sends the results back to the Nagios monitoring server. The Nagios monitoring server then evaluates the results and raises an alert if any of the monitored resources exceed the configured thresholds.

By using NRPE, you can monitor the resources of the remote server in real-time and receive alerts when any issues arise. This allows you to quickly identify and resolve any problems, ensuring the smooth operation of the critical application.


Sure! Here are the steps to configure the NRPE daemon to allow requests from the Nagios monitoring server:

1. Install the NRPE daemon on the remote system. This can usually be done using the package manager of your Linux distribution (e.g. apt-get for Debian/Ubuntu, yum for Red Hat/CentOS).

2. Edit the NRPE configuration file, which is usually located at `/etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg`. Uncomment the line that starts with `allowed_hosts` and add the IP address or hostname of the Nagios monitoring server. For example:

```
allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.100
```

This allows requests from the local system (127.0.0.1) and from the Nagios monitoring server at IP address 192.168.1.100.

3. Restart the NRPE daemon to apply the changes. This can usually be done using the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart nrpe
```

4. On the Nagios monitoring server, edit the NRPE plugin configuration file, which is usually located at `/etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg`. Add an entry for the remote system, specifying the IP address or hostname and the plugins to be executed. For example:

```
define host {
  use           linux-server
  host_name     remote-server-1
  alias         Remote Server 1
  address       192.168.1.101
}

define service {
  use           generic-service
  host_name     remote-server-1
  service_description CPU Usage
  check_command check_nrpe!check_cpu_usage
}
```

This defines a host named "remote-server-1" with IP address 192.168.1.101 and a service to monitor CPU usage using the `check_cpu_usage` plugin on the remote system.

5. Restart the Nagios service to apply the changes. This can usually be done using the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart nagios
```

With these steps, the NRPE daemon on the remote system is configured to allow requests from the Nagios monitoring server and the NRPE plugin on the Nagios monitoring server is configured to send requests to the remote system and execute the specified plugins.


Certainly! Here are some steps to troubleshoot NRPE if it's not working:

1. Check the NRPE daemon logs on the remote system. The logs are usually located in the system log directory (e.g. `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/syslog`). Look for any error messages or warnings that indicate a problem with the NRPE daemon.

2. Check the NRPE plugin logs on the Nagios monitoring server. The logs are usually located in the Nagios log directory (e.g. `/var/log/nagios/nrpe.log`). Look for any error messages or warnings that indicate a problem with the NRPE plugin.

3. Check the firewall settings on the remote system. NRPE uses TCP port 5666 by default, so make sure this port is open on the remote system's firewall. You can use the `telnet` command to test if the port is open:

```
telnet remote-system-ip 5666
```

If the port is not open, you need to add a firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on port 5666.

4. Check the configuration of the NRPE daemon on the remote system. Make sure the `allowed_hosts` setting in the NRPE configuration file includes the IP address or hostname of the Nagios monitoring server. Also make sure the `command` setting in the NRPE configuration file points to the correct plugin location.

5. Check the configuration of the NRPE plugin on the Nagios monitoring server. Make sure the `command` setting in the NRPE plugin configuration file points to the correct plugin location on the remote system.

6. Test the NRPE connection using the `check_nrpe` command on the Nagios monitoring server. For example:

```
check_nrpe -H remote-system-ip -c check_cpu_usage
```

This should execute the `check_cpu_usage` plugin on the remote system and return the result to the Nagios monitoring server. If this command fails, it indicates a problem with the NRPE configuration or the plugin on the remote system.

By following these steps, you can identify and resolve common issues with NRPE and ensure that it is working properly for monitoring remote systems.


The exact steps to add a firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on port 5666 depend on the Linux distribution and firewall software you are using on the remote system. Here are some general steps that should work on most Linux distributions:

1. Identify the firewall software in use on the remote system. The most common firewall software on Linux systems are `iptables` and `firewalld`.

2. Determine if the firewall is running and if it is enabled to start at boot time. You can use the following commands to check the firewall status:

For `iptables`:
```
sudo systemctl status iptables
```

For `firewalld`:
```
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

3. If the firewall is not running, you can start it using the following commands:

For `iptables`:
```
sudo systemctl start iptables
```

For `firewalld`:
```
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

4. Add a firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on port 5666. The exact command to add the rule depends on the firewall software in use. Here are some examples:

For `iptables`:
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5666 -j ACCEPT
```

For `firewalld`:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5666/tcp --permanent
```

The `--permanent` option makes the rule persist across reboots.

5. Reload the firewall configuration to apply the new rule. The exact command to reload the firewall configuration depends on the firewall software in use. Here are some examples:

For `iptables`:
```
sudo service iptables save
sudo service iptables restart
```

For `firewalld`:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

With these steps, you should have added a firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on port 5666, which should allow NRPE to function properly. Note that these steps are just a general guideline and the exact commands and procedures may vary depending on your specific system configuration.


You can check if the firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on port 5666 was successfully added by listing the firewall rules and checking if the new rule is present. The exact command to list the firewall rules depends on the firewall software in use. Here are some examples:

For `iptables`:
```
sudo iptables -L INPUT -n | grep 5666
```

This command lists the INPUT chain of the `iptables` firewall and searches for any rules that match port 5666.

If the rule was successfully added, the output should include a line similar to this:

```
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:5666
```

This indicates that the firewall is now allowing incoming traffic on port 5666.

For `firewalld`:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

This command lists the currently allowed ports in the `firewalld` firewall.

If the rule was successfully added, the output should include a line similar to this:

```
5666/tcp
```

This indicates that the firewall is now allowing incoming traffic on port 5666.

By checking the firewall rule using these commands, you can verify that the rule was successfully added and that the firewall is now allowing incoming traffic on port 5666.
