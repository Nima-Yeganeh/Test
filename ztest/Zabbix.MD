```

These settings increase the maximum execution time, memory limit, and file upload sizes for PHP.

8. Restart the services:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm
sudo systemctl restart zabbix-server zabbix-agent
sudo systemctl enable nginx php7.4-fpm zabbix-server zabbix-agent
```

9. Access the Zabbix web interface by navigating to `http://server-ip-address/zabbix` in your web browser. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

That's it! You should now have Zabbix installed and running on your Ubuntu system.


Yes, there are several ways to automate the installation of the Zabbix agent on multiple servers. Here are a few options:

1. Use a configuration management tool like Ansible or Puppet to automate the installation of the Zabbix agent on multiple servers. These tools allow you to define the desired state of your servers in code, and then automatically configure them to match that state. You can create a playbook or manifest that installs the Zabbix agent package and configures it with the appropriate settings, and then run that playbook/manifest on all the servers you want to configure.

2. Use a package management tool like apt or yum to install the Zabbix agent package on multiple servers. You can use a tool like Ansible or Puppet to execute the package installation command on all the servers you want to configure. For example, to install the Zabbix agent package on Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt install zabbix-agent
```

And to install the package on Red Hat/CentOS systems, use the following command:

```
sudo yum install zabbix-agent
```

3. Use a remote execution tool like SSH or PowerShell to execute the installation command on multiple servers. You can write a script that logs into each server and executes the appropriate installation command for that system. For example, to install the Zabbix agent on a Debian/Ubuntu system using SSH, you can use the following command:

```
ssh username@server-ip-address 'sudo apt install zabbix-agent -y'
```

And to install the agent on a Windows system using PowerShell, you can use the following command:

```
Invoke-Command -ComputerName server-ip-address -ScriptBlock {Install-Package -Name zabbix-agent}
```

These are just a few examples of the many ways you can automate the installation of the Zabbix agent on multiple servers. The best approach will depend on your specific environment and the tools you have available.


Certainly! Here are the steps to configure the Zabbix agent after installation:

1. Edit the Zabbix agent configuration file:

```
sudo nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
```

This file contains the settings for the Zabbix agent. You can modify the following settings as needed:

- `Server=`: Set this to the IP address or hostname of the Zabbix server or proxy that the agent should send data to.
- `ServerActive=`: Set this to the IP address or hostname of the Zabbix server or proxy that the agent should actively connect to for data collection.
- `Hostname=`: Set this to a unique identifier for the host that the agent is running on. This should match the hostname configured in the Zabbix server or proxy.
- `EnableRemoteCommands=`: Set this to `1` to allow the Zabbix server or proxy to execute commands on the agent.
- `LogFile=`: Set this to the location of the agent log file.

2. Restart the Zabbix agent:

```
sudo systemctl restart zabbix-agent
```

3. Configure the Zabbix server or proxy to monitor the new host:

If you are using a Zabbix server or proxy, you will need to configure it to monitor the new host. This involves creating a new host in the Zabbix web interface and linking it to the appropriate templates and items. Here are the general steps:

- Log in to the Zabbix web interface and navigate to the "Configuration" section.
- Click on "Hosts" and then click the "Create host" button.
- Enter a name for the new host and set the IP address or DNS name to match the `Hostname=` setting in the Zabbix agent configuration file.
- Set the "Agent" interface to use the default port (10050) and configure any additional interfaces as needed.
- Select the appropriate templates and items to monitor the host, and configure them as needed.
- Save the new host configuration.

4. Verify that the Zabbix agent is sending data:

You can check that the Zabbix agent is sending data to the Zabbix server or proxy by looking at the "Latest data" section in the Zabbix web interface. This should show data for the new host and any items that you have configured to monitor it.

By following these steps, you can configure the Zabbix agent to send data to the Zabbix server or proxy and set up monitoring for the new host in the Zabbix web interface.


Certainly! Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot if the Zabbix agent is not sending data:

1. Check the Zabbix agent log file:

The Zabbix agent logs its activity to the file specified in the `LogFile=` setting in the configuration file. You can check this file for any error messages or warnings that may indicate why the agent is not sending data. For example, on Ubuntu systems, the log file is located at `/var/log/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.log`.

2. Check the Zabbix server or proxy log file:

If the Zabbix agent is not sending data, it may be because the Zabbix server or proxy is not receiving it. You can check the log file for the Zabbix server or proxy to see if it is receiving any data from the agent. On Ubuntu systems, the log file is located at `/var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log`.

3. Verify the Zabbix agent configuration:

Check the `Server=` and `ServerActive=` settings in the Zabbix agent configuration file to make sure they are set correctly. If you are using a Zabbix proxy, make sure the `Server=` setting is set to the IP address or hostname of the Zabbix proxy, and not the Zabbix server.

Also, check the `Hostname=` setting in the Zabbix agent configuration file to make sure it matches the hostname configured in the Zabbix server or proxy.

4. Verify the Zabbix item configuration:

Check the Zabbix item configuration in the Zabbix web interface to make sure it is configured correctly. Make sure the item is assigned to the correct host and that the item key is set correctly. Also, check any trigger or graph configurations to make sure they are also set up correctly.

5. Verify the Zabbix server or proxy configuration:

Check the Zabbix server or proxy configuration to make sure it is set up correctly. Make sure the Zabbix server or proxy is running and able to receive data from the agent. Also, check any firewall or network settings that may be blocking communication between the agent and the server or proxy.

By following these steps, you can troubleshoot why the Zabbix agent is not sending data and take the necessary steps to fix the issue.


Yes, there are several ways to check if the Zabbix server or proxy configuration is set up correctly. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Check the Zabbix server or proxy log file:

The Zabbix server or proxy logs its activity to the file specified in the `LogFile=` setting in the configuration file. You can check this file for any error messages or warnings that may indicate a problem with the configuration. For example, on Ubuntu systems, the log file is located at `/var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log`.

2. Verify that the Zabbix server or proxy is running:

Check that the Zabbix server or proxy is running and able to receive data from the agents. On Ubuntu systems, you can use the following command to check the status of the Zabbix server or proxy:

```
sudo systemctl status zabbix-server zabbix-proxy
```

If the service is running, you should see output indicating that the service is active and running.

3. Verify that the Zabbix server or proxy is listening on the correct ports:

Check that the Zabbix server or proxy is listening on the correct ports for incoming agent connections. By default, the Zabbix agent listens on port 10050. You can use the `netstat` command to check if the Zabbix server or proxy is listening on this port. For example, on Ubuntu systems, you can use the following command:

```
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 10050
```

This should show output indicating that the Zabbix server or proxy is listening on port 10050.

4. Verify that the Zabbix server or proxy can communicate with the agents:

Check that the Zabbix server or proxy can communicate with the agents by sending a test message to the agent. You can use the `zabbix_sender` command to send a test message to the agent. For example, to send a test message to an agent running on the IP address `192.0.2.1`, use the following command:

```
echo "test message" | zabbix_sender -z 192.0.2.1 -s "test host" -k "test.key"
```

Replace `192.0.2.1` with the IP address of the agent, `test host` with the hostname of the agent, and `test.key` with the key of the item you want to send the message to.

If the Zabbix server or proxy can communicate with the agent, you should see output indicating that the message was sent successfully.

By following these steps, you can check if the Zabbix server or proxy configuration is set up correctly and take the necessary steps to fix any issues.
